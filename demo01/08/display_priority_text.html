<h2>Must</h2>
<p>1. Annual update. The Act requires agencies to provide annual updates on their implementation of the provisions of the Act. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> report to OMB each year by December 15th on the following general elements (see section 101, 44 U.S.C. � 3606 and Section 207(e)(4)):<br />a. the status of implementing e-government initiatives,<br />b. how E-Government initiatives have improved performance in delivering programs to constituencies;<br />c. changes to their business processes in order to comply with this guidance and the Act; and<br />d. compliance with other requirements in the Act.</p>
<p>1.4. Who should use the guidance - In the sense that at promulgation it represents a future scenario of operations, this guidance recommends that all involved entities take steps to develop and annually execute plans and report to the FGDC Steering Committee on their progress in implementing this guidance. The FGDC Steering Committee <span class="priority">will</span> annually recommend government-wide steps for achievement of the portfolio management approach, <span class="priority">will</span> annually report the NGDA Portfolio status to agency CFOs and CIOs and OMB, and <span class="priority">will</span> ensure that appropriate resources are identified in the agency budget requests to OMB. The FGDC Secretariat <span class="priority">will</span> consult with agencies to support definition and development of their agency-specific roles, responsibilities, and obligations through education and use of standards.</p>
<p>2. Federal Accounting Standards:<br />When applicable, agency financial management systems <span class="priority">shall</span> maintain accounting data to permit reporting in accordance with Federal accounting standards, and reporting requirements issued by the Director of OMB and/or the Secretary of the Treasury. Where no accounting standards have been recommended by FASAB and issued by the Director of OMB, the systems <span class="priority">shall</span> maintain data in accordance with the applicable accounting standards used by the agency for preparation of its financial statements.</p>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - All spatial data collected by federal agencies or their agents, as described in section 5, <span class="priority">will</span> be made available through the Clearinghouse. Spatial data users <span class="priority">will</span> have access to the NSDI through the National Spatial Data Clearinghouse.</p>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - Federal agencies and the FGDC carry out the activities required to implement their responsibilities as described in section 8 of this Circular. Agencies <span class="priority">will</span> provide or develop the required technology and services required to enable and provide access to NSDI data and information. The OMB <span class="priority">will</span> work with affected budget offices to provide appropriate resources in support of these activities.</p>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - Federal agencies <span class="priority">will</span> promote and fully utilize partnerships that promote cost-effective data collection, documentation, maintenance, distribution, and preservation strategies, and that leverage federal and other resources. New collaborative efforts and partnerships <span class="priority">are encouraged</span>.</p>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - International compatibility is an important aspect of the NSDI. Federal agencies <span class="priority">will</span> develop their international spatial data in compliance with international voluntary consensus standards, as defined by Circular A-119.</p>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - No federal funds <span class="priority">will</span> be used directly or indirectly for the development of spatial data not complying with NSDI standards, as specified by FGDC.</p>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - Standards are common and repeated rules, conditions, guidelines or characteristics for data, and related processes, technology and organization. To broaden the global use of federal data and services, international standards and protocols <span class="priority">must</span> be used. NSDI is made possible by the universal use of standards and protocols for data development, documentation, exchange, and geospatial services.</p>
<p>3. Application of the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the Transaction Level:<br />Financial events <span class="priority">shall</span> be recorded applying the requirements of the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger (USSGL). Application of the USSGL at the transaction level means that each time an approved transaction is recorded in the system, it will generate appropriate general ledger accounts for posting the transaction according to the rules defined in the USSGL guidance.</p>
<p>3.2. Inventory - NGDA Theme Leads, the FGDC Coordination Group, or the FGDC Steering Committee can annually create, update or replace (delete) themes and/or datasets through the collaborative review process � OMB <span class="priority">must</span> be informed upon the addition or deletion of NGDA Themes accepted by the FGDC Steering Committee.</p>
<p>3.4.1. NGDA Dataset Management - NGDA Dataset Managers <span class="priority">should</span> evaluate their NGDA Dataset(s) against the Geospatial Data Lifecycle stages in order to report on their maturity and status. They <span class="priority">should</span> also report on how they are conforming to the NGDA Dataset Managers� responsibilities, expended resources (dollars and full time equivalent [FTE]) staff), and other performance measures concurred upon by the FGDC Steering Committee. If funding information is not currently available, NGDA Dataset Managers <span class="priority">should</span> work with their agency leadership to develop means of tracking this financial information. The NGDA Dataset Manager <span class="priority">will</span> annually submit an NGDA Dataset Report to the relevant NGDA Theme Lead and <span class="priority">will</span> assist with incorporation of that information into a comprehensive annual NGDA Theme Report.</p>
<p>3.4.2. NGDA Theme Management - NGDA Theme Leads <span class="priority">will</span> also coordinate with other NGDA Theme Leads to ensure that NGDA Datasets applicable to more than one NGDA Theme are effectively co-developed. The FGDC Secretariat <span class="priority">will</span> facilitate these coordination activities.</p>
<p>3.5. Evaluate/Monitor - NGDA Theme Leads <span class="priority">will</span> develop NGDA Theme Reports that capture plans for, milestones for, and progress in establishing the necessary organizational structures and resources. Theme Lead    Agencies <span class="priority">will</span> submit NGDA Theme Reports to the FGDC Secretariat for summarization, and to the FGDC Coordination Group for analysis and development of a NGDA Portfolio Summary. Based on this analysis the FGDC Coordination Group <span class="priority">will</span> make annual recommendations to the Steering Committee on NGDA Portfolio actions.</p>
<p>3.6. Identify and Execute Interagency Priorities - NGDA Theme Leads and members of the FGDC Coordination Group have roles in identifying and recommending NGDA Dataset development priorities to the FGDC Steering Committee; the FGDC Steering Committee, in turn, assesses them and makes/shares the recommendations with agency CFOs and CIOs and OMB. NGDA Theme Leads <span class="priority">will</span> periodically make presentations to both the FGDC Coordination Group and FGDC Steering Committee providing updates on NGDA Theme requirements as determined by their Thematic Committees and communities of interest, as incorporated in the annual NGDA Theme Report, or as requested by agency or FGDC leadership</p>
<p>3.6. Identify and Execute Interagency Priorities - The FGDC Steering Committee <span class="priority">will</span> be responsible for 1) assessing the recommendations in the context of overall FGDC strategic goals and objectives; 2) coming to concurrence on cross-agency NGDA Dataset development and funding priorities; and 3) presenting these recommendations to agency CFOs and OMB.</p>
<p>4. Support of OMB reports. OMB is also required to report to Congress on several initiatives, and agencies may receive requests from OMB for information about their participation in such areas as the IT Exchange Program and other IT workforce initiatives (Sec 209), use of share-in-savings contracts (Section 210), integration of data elements (Section 212), and community technology centers (Section 213).</p>
<p>4. What is the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)?  - The Department of the Interior <span class="priority">will</span> provide administrative support to the FGDC.</p>
<p>4.3. Roles and Responsibilities - In the RACI matrix, roles have been assigned to the lowest possible person or entity in the hierarchy.  For each task, at least one person or entity <span class="priority">must</span> be �responsible�, but again, due to the complexity of NGDA Portfolio management and the need for coordination among multiple people or entities, there <span class="priority">may</span> be more than one responsible party associated with each stage of the portfolio management process. For �consulted,� only those persons or entities that <span class="priority">must</span> be always consulted are indicated.  Consultations with persons or entities not included in this matrix <span class="priority">may</span> also occur, but are not always required. Detailed roles and responsibilities associated with each component of the NGDA Portfolio management process are contained in Reference Document: Roles and Responsibilities.</p>
<p>5.1 Benefits - The FGDC <span class="priority">will</span> work with OMB, NGDA Theme Leads, and NGDA Dataset Managers using the FGDC governance structure to lay out an aggressive but achievable process whereby funding levels for the NGDA Datasets become known over time.</p>
<p>5.3 Staged Process Implementation - The FGDC <span class="priority">will</span> coordinate with OMB and the agency CFO/CIO community to ensure a consistent approach to providing the required level of resolution of financial information for NGDA Datasets, recognizing that some agencies may require more time in order to satisfy the reporting requirements.</p>

<p>Aggregate demand to support leveraged buying events - Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> focus the bulk of their acquisition of laptops and desktops on publicized buying events to maximize the Government's collective buying power. A best practice is to host semi-annual buying events where requirements across agencies are consolidated to leverage buying and drive down costs, and the WCT <span class="priority">will</span> require this practice for GSA Schedule 70, NITAAC CIO-CS, and NASA SEWP. Furthermore, the WCT <span class="priority">will</span> work with GSA to create tools on the Acquisition Gateway to help organizations consolidate requirements to better leverage their spending. Agencies <span class="priority">shall</span>, to the maximum extent practicable, participate in these buying events.</p>
<p>All agencies <span class="priority">must</span> ensure that, at a minimum, the CIO and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) positions are designated as sensitive positions and the incumbents have Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information access.</p>

<p>All proposed strategic sourcing agreements <span class="priority">must</span> baseline small business use under current strategies and set goals to meet or exceed that baseline participation under the new strategic sourcing vehicles.</p>
<p>Although SmartBUY does not mandate particular application solutions, agencies are <span class="priority">encouraged</span> to use this agreement to acquire other Oracle products whenever they are selected as a technical solution. Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> engage in discussions with Oracle to acquire application solutions from its other product lines. Agencies achieving further product discounts from Oracle are <span class="priority">required</span> to provide SmartBUY with a copy of the actual quote and supporting requirement information.</p>
<p>An agency <span class="priority">may</span> rely on its in-house operations if the agency demonstrates to OMB that its internal operations represent a best value and lower risk alternative. This demonstration <span class="priority">shall</span> be made through the establishment of a most efficient organization and public-private competition, unless there is a justified basis for foregoing competition or for using a limited form of competition, such as public-public competition. The justification <span class="priority">shall</span> be documented in the same general manner prescribed in Part 6 of the FAR for the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>An agency�s IT investment management and reporting of IT investments <span class="priority">must</span> clearly demonstrate that each investment is needed to help meet the agency's strategic goals and mission and show how governance processes are used to plan, select, develop, implement, and operate those IT investments.</p>
<p>An official letter, signed by the head of the agency, which provides their comprehensive assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of their agency�s information security policies, procedures, and practices, <span class="priority">must</span> be submitted to OMB.</p>
<p>Any data center initiation, significant expansion, or migration project that receives Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DM&E) funds in fiscal year 2017 and beyond <span class="priority">must</span> immediately implement automated monitoring and management tools. However, agencies are strongly encouraged to implement automated monitoring and management tools throughout their data centers immediately.</p>
<p>As a part of that [capital planning and investment control] guidance [ref. Req. 81.22], the following approaches <span class="priority">will</span> be used to meet FITARA requirements: Monthly reporting. Covered agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> continue to provide updates of risks, performance metrics, project, and activity data for major IT investments to the ITDB as soon as the data becomes available, or at least once each calendar month.</p>
<p>As an immediate action to implement these recommendations, OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> consider these initiatives as part of its review of the Federal Acquisition Certifications for Program/Project Managers (P/PMs), Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTR), and contracting professionals in the next six months.</p>
<p>As of this date, OMB is establishing the Financial Systems Advisory Board (Board) under the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Council. The Board <span class="priority">will</span> include CFOs and CIOs from major agencies and have available experts from various communities, including acquisition and e-government. Its function <span class="priority">will</span> be to make recommendations to OMB, as requested, on projects being reviewed under this memorandum. Agencies with longstanding expertise in IT project management may also be asked to participate more extensively and directly with OMB in the overall review process.</p>
<p>As part of the FY 2012 Budget formulation process, CIO Council agencies will be required to develop and put in place improvement plans for their highest-risk IT projects. Pursuant to that objective, agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> take the following steps: <br />1. Identify agency high-risk IT projects, <br />2. Develop improvement plans for these projects, and <br />3. Present improvement plans in TechStat sessions. The steps of this process are detailed below. <br /><br />1. Identify Agency High-Risk IT Projects <br />The Federal CIO will select, collaboratively with agency CIOs, the high-risk IT projects across the Federal Government. Using the IT Dashboard and other sources of information, agency CIOs <span class="priority">shall</span> describe the risk profile of the largest, most complex IT projects. Risk factors would include: - Significant cost or schedule variance from the current baseline<br />- Performance targets or mission objectives have not been met, <br />- Frequent re-baselines, or <br />- Lack of essential executive sponsorship/leadership.<br /><br />The Federal CIO will schedule individual sessions with agency CIOs (as outlined in attachment A), between August 2 and August 18, to identify the highest risk projects across the Federal IT portfolio. The list of high-risk projects will be finalized by August 23. It is anticipated that 25 to 30 projects will be selected across the Federal government.<br /><br />2. Develop Improvement Plans<br />Agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> submit a proposed improvement plan for each high-risk project. Agencies<br /><span class="priority">shall</span> submit proposed improvement plans to OMB no later than 30 days after their high-risk<br />projects are identified. While formal improvement plans are only required for these projects, agency CIOs are accountable for the performance of the entire IT portfolio, not limited to just the high-risk projects. Therefore, similar improvement plans should be applied to other high-risk projects in an agency�s entire IT portfolio. Agency proposed improvement plans should be based on thorough analysis of the projects� issues and risks. Plans should be comprehensive, risk-adjusted, and reviewed through appropriate agency governance bodies. The plan may incorporate short and long term solutions that may extend through Budget Year 2012. If the agency CIO does not have high confidence in the probability of success of the investment, the agency CIO should recommend that the project be materially altered or terminated.<br /> <br />The proposed improvement plan should include:<br />a. Major challenges and causes of variance from the project baseline,<br />b. A summary of risks, mitigation strategies, and clear accountability,<br />c. Stronger contractor performance metrics and controls for existing contracts, and revised<br />acquisition strategies for contracts expected to be executed within the next fiscal year that<br />address the issues raised in the improvement plan,<br />d. A high-level schedule that articulates critical path items,<br />e. Agencies should describe how the project�s governance will be more rigorous because of<br />the improvement plan. Agencies should also describe how they will improve both<br />contract and program management oversight internally to ensure better performance, and<br />f. List the specific corrective actions to turn around the project.<br /><br />3. Present Improvement Plans in TechStat Sessions<br />The proposed improvement plans for the selected high-risk projects will be reviewed in<br />OMB TechStat Accountability Sessions led by the Federal CIO. These sessions will be conducted between September and November. At the TechStat session, the agency will brief OMB on the improvement plans, revised schedules, and potential changes to budget requests.<br /><br />The TechStat sessions will be used to inform OMB decisions on FY 2012 budget requests<br />and potential FY 2011 apportionments. TechStat sessions will also provide feedback and<br />recommendations to agencies concerning project scope, management and oversight.</p>
<p>As part of the budget process, OMB is <span class="priority">required</span> to develop and oversee a process for IT budgeting and portfolio management, with a detailed focus on all major capital investments, to include �analyzing, tracking, and evaluating the risks, including information security risks, and results of all major capital investments made by an executive agency for information systems�. 40 U.S.C. � 11302. OMB also is <span class="priority">responsible</span> for IT Portfolio oversight (44 U.S.C. � 3602), i.e. the use of information technologies to enhance access of information and delivery of services; and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation of government operations.</p>

<p>B. Section 207 of the E-Government Act requires your agency to develop priorities and schedules for making Government information available and accessible to the public, in accordance with public comment, and to post this information on your agency�s website.  Section 207 also requires your agency to report to OMB, as part of the agency�s annual E-Government Act report, the final determinations of inventories, priorities, and schedules your agency has made.</p>
<p>B. These [Linking policies] policies <span class="priority">must</span> appropriately limit external linking to information or services necessary for the proper performance of an agency function.</p>
<p>B. You <span class="priority">must</span> now ensure your agency�s principal public website and any major entry point include a search function.  However, agencies may determine in limited circumstances (e.g., for small websites) site maps or subject indexes are more effective than a typical search function.</p>
<p>B. Your agency is already required to provide adequate security controls to ensure information is resistant to tampering to preserve accuracy, remains confidential as necessary, and the information or service is available as intended by the agency and expected by users.  Agencies must also implement management controls to prevent the inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information.</p>
<p>B. Your agency is already required to provide appropriate access for people with limited English proficiency by implementing Department of Justice guidance for Executive Order 13166, �Improving Access to Services for People with Limited English Proficiency.�  Agencies must determine whether any individual document on their Federal agency public website(s) requires translation.</p>
<p>B. Your agency is already <span class="priority">required</span> under the Paperwork Reduction Act to manage information collections from the public or State and local governments (including website surveys or questionnaires) in the manner prescribed in OMB�s guidance in 5 CFR section 1320.  For additional information see:</p>

<p>Beginning March 1, 2007 and each quarter thereafter, agencies <span class="priority">will</span> post to their federal agency public website a report on the number of PIV credentials issued. Agencies must use the attached report template to distinguish between credentials issued to employees, contractors, and others (e.g., visiting scientists). The website address should be provided to OMB at eauth@omb.eop.gov by the due date. For agencies using GSA or Interior shared services, you may elect to have your service provider post your quarterly status to their public website.</p>
<p>Beginning immediately, the Federal Government <span class="priority">will</span> shift to a "Cloud First" policy. The three-part strategy on cloud technology <span class="priority">will</span> revolve around using commercial could where feasible, launching private government clouds, and utilizing regional clouds with state and local governments where appropriate.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> report on government-wide and agency-specific data center progress as part of the IT Dashboard, which <span class="priority">will</span> display:<br />� Planned and achieved data center closures by agency;<br />� Government-wide and agency progress toward meeting applicable optimization targets;<br />� Cumulative cost savings and cost avoidance realized through the implementation of the DCOI and prior initiatives; and<br />� Annual data center investment spending per agency, including investment transition costs, cost savings projections, progress made against projections and improvements realized through the implementation of the strategy.</p>
<p>Beginning in the first quarter of FY 2011, to align with this guidance, financial system investments subject to this guidance <span class="priority">will</span> be apportioned consistent with a segmented approach. Where the apportionment process is employed, funding shall be controlled under Category B on a quarterly basis. As such, contracts shall reflect the overall implementation phase of 18 to 24 months, with task orders written to reflect 90 to 120-day deliverables. Task orders shall be funded consistent with the apportionment � after OMB review throughout the development, modernization, and execution phases. For projects that OMB has not designated as high-risk or that have a proven track record of achieving specific milestones within well-defined segments, OMB may employ flexibility regarding funds control. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB shall assess whether or not an investment should receive funding for the next segment. If approved, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> apportion funding for the next segment under Category B. If approval is not granted, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> work with the affected agency to redirect funding pursuant to existing Congressional reprogramming requirements. An agency�s failure to complete a segment as planned may be a basis for canceling the remaining investment. Additionally, inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate data or documentation may be justification for redirecting funding.</p>
<p>Build information systems to support interoperability and information accessibility- Through their acquisition and technology management processes, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> build or modernize information systems in a way that maximizes interoperability and information accessibility, to the extent practicable and permitted by law. To this end, agencies should leverage existing Federal IT guidance, such as the Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture, when designing information systems. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> exercise forethought when architecting, building, or substantially modifying an information system to facilitate public distribution, where appropriate. In addition, the agency's CIO <span class="priority">must</span> validate that the following minimum requirements have been incorporated into acquisition planning documents and technical design for all new information systems and those preparing for modernization, as appropriate: a. The system design <span class="priority">must</span> be scalable, flexible, and facilitate extraction of data in multiple formats and for a range of uses as internal and external needs change, including potential uses not accounted for in the original design. In general, this will involve the use of standards and specifications in the system design that promote industry best practices for information sharing, and separation of data from the application layer to maximize data reuse opportunities and incorporation of future application or technology capabilities, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data; b. All data outputs associated with the system <span class="priority">must</span> meet the requirements described in part III, sections l. a-e of this Memorandum and be accounted for in the data inventory described in part III section 3 .a; and c. Data schema and dictionaries have been documented and shared with internal pmtners and the public, as applicable.</p>
<p>By April 15, 2004, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in conjunction with the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) <span class="priority">will</span> compile a list of all software acquisitions (by any purchase mechanism including credit cards) during calendar year 2003 by the name and version of the software and prepare a projection of the software acquisitions for calendar year 2004.  <span class="action">Submit</span> the lists to OMB and GSA. Start the lists with the ten initial SmartBuy opportunities depicted by market category (see Attachment 1).  For each category, <span class="action">provide</span> the name of the software, the number of units purchased, the lowest and highest price paid for the software, the total cost for the year and the average price paid.  For the 2004 projections, <span class="action">provide</span> the total units expected to be purchased by category.</p>
<p>By March 2011, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> work with Agency CIOs and other agency leaders to stand up the �TechStat� model at the departmental level. Steps include<br />� OMB <span class="priority">will</span> assist agencies in designing tools and enforcing their use, to provide the transparency required for the �TechStat� model to be effective.<br />� OMB analysts <span class="priority">will</span> provide in-person training to Agency CIOs in �TechStat� methodology including accountability guidelines, engagement cadence, evaluation processes, and reporting processes.<br />� Agency leaders <span class="priority">will</span> lead, sponsor, and manage the process within their departments.</p>
<p>By May of 2011, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> reconstruct the 300s and 53s [�] The timing of these elements <span class="priority">will</span> be separated into distinct streams to clarify objectives, give agencies adequate time to assemble strong responses, and improve data quality. These streams <span class="priority">will</span> include:<br />� Budget justification for new major Development, Modernization and Enhancement (DME) investments, significant re-engineering of existing DME investments, and annual re-justification of DME investments.<br />� Health monitoring of existing DME investments and Operations and Maintenance (O&M)<br />� Portfolio governance to ensure the IT portfolio and individual projects are consistent with the agency mission and Federal policy objectives</p>

<p>Create a process to engage with customers to help facilitate and prioritize data release Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> create a process to engage with customers, through their www.[agency] .gov/data pages and other necessary means, to solicit help in prioritizing the release of datasets and determining the most usable and appropriate formats for release?6 Agencies should make data available in multiple formats according to their customer needs. For example, high-volume datasets of interest to developers should be released using bulk downloads as well as Application Programming Interfaces (Apies). In addition, customer engagement eff01ts should help agencies prioritize efforts to improve the discoverability and usability of datasets that have already been released to the public but are not yet fully "open" (e.g., they are only available in closed, inaccessible formats). See Project Open Data for best practices and tools that can be used to implement customer engagement efforts.</p>
<p>Create and maintain an enterprise data inventory- Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> update their inventory of agency information resources (as required by OMB Circular A-130)24 to include an enterprise data inventory, if it does not already exist, that accounts for datasets used in the agency' s information systems. The inventory will be built out over time, with the ultimate goal of including all agency datasets, to the extent practicable. The inventory will indicate, as appropriate, if the agency has determined that the individual datasets may be made publicly available (i.e., release is permitted by law, subject to all privacy, confidentiality, security, and other valid requirements) and whether they are currently available to the public. The Senior Agency Official for Records Management should be consulted on integration with the records management process. Agencies should use the Data Reference Model from the Federal Enterprise Architecture to help create and maintain their inventory. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> describe datasets within the inventory using the common core and extensible metadata (see part III, section l.e).</p>
<p>Current �Core Financial System� requirements remain in effect and Federal agencies have an ongoing responsibility to comply with them. OMB <span class="priority">will</span> soon issue a revision to OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, which <span class="priority">will</span> update existing requirements and include new guidance on how agencies and auditors <span class="priority">will</span> assess compliance with these requirements. Specifically, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> initiate a performance based approach to assessing compliance that <span class="priority">will</span> assist in the overall objective to reduce the cost, risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations. The objective of this approach <span class="priority">will</span> be to provide additional flexibility for Federal agencies to initiate smaller scale financial modernizations as long as relevant financial management outcomes (e.g., clean audits, proper controls, timely reporting) are maintained.</p>
<p>D1. CIO reviews and approves major IT investment portion of budget request. Agency budget justification materials in their initial budget submission to OMB <span class="priority">shall</span> include a statement that affirms: the CIO has reviewed and approves the major IT investments portion of this budget request; the CFO and CIO jointly affirm that the CIO had a significant role in reviewing planned IT support for major program objectives and significant increases and decreases in IT resources; and the IT Portfolio (formerly Exhibit 53) includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the bud get request.

Define and regularly update the FedRAMP security authorization requirements in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) and DHS guidance; <br />iii. Approve accreditation criteria for third-party assessment organizations (3PAOs) to provide independent assessments of CSPs� implementation of the FedRAMP security authorization requirements; <br />iv. Establish and publish priority queue requirements for authorization package reviews; <br />v. Review authorization packages for cloud services based on the priority queue; <br />vi. Grant provisional authorizations for cloud services that can be used as an initial approval that Executive departments and agencies leverage in granting security authorizations and an accompanying authority to operate (ATO) for use; <br />vii. Ensure that provisional authorizations are reviewed and updated regularly and notify Executive departments and agencies of any changes to provisional authorizations including removal of such authorizations; and <br />viii. Establish methods for input to the FedRAMP security authorization requirements from all Executive departments and agencies.</p>
<p>Data centers <span class="priority">shall</span> be categorized into two groups: tiered data centers and non-tiered data centers. [Footnote:] The term �tiered� and the definitions that follow are derived from the Uptime Institute�s Tier Classification System; however, this <span class="priority">shall</span> not be construed as requiring any certification in order for a data center to be considered tiered by OMB.</p>
<p>Data will be collected quarterly on an agency-by-agency basis through the IDC [Integrated Data Collection], as follows:<br />1. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> continue to maintain complete inventories of all data center facilities, closure/consolidation plans, and properties of each facility owned, operated, or maintained by or on behalf of the agency.</p>
<p>Department and agency leaders <span class="priority">must</span> be held accountable, as required by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. The Administration <span class="priority">should</span> work with Congress to update and strengthen this legislation. Performance plans of the department and agency leadership <span class="priority">should</span> include reporting on progress made to secure systems by each department and agency. The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> develop options to hold department and agency leadership accountable for compliance with cybersecurity policies and to enforce implementation of appropriate cybersecurity procedures.</p>
<p>DoD policy <span class="priority">shall</span> address the following items for Performance Management Systems: <br />a. DoD <span class="priority">shall</span> establish Earned Value (EV) measurement policy to guide the development of DoD major8 <br />b. DoD is required to update investment performance data on the Federal IT Dashboard, specifically cost and schedule data, for DoD major IT investments, on a monthly basis; performance measurement data when actual data has been measured (annually, at a minimum), and CIO Assessments and contract data when significant changes IT investments.  <br />c. DoD is encouraged to report a transparent view of the investment baseline on the Federal IT Dashboard. Level 3 of the WBS has been communicated as a guideline as Levels 1 and 2 typically do not provide enough information to describe the work to be accomplished in short enough duration that early warnings of investment performance can be identified. occur with the investment. <br />a. DoD <span class="priority">shall</span> be able to provide EV measurement reports upon request to OMB to certify compliance with this policy using the standard template attached in Appendix B and may propose an alternative reports approved by the Agency CIO, to OMB using concepts similar to that used in Appendix B. <br />d. DoD <span class="priority">shall</span> provide OMB with copies of the Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) and MAR annual congressional reports.</p>
<p>Due to significant extent of these changes [required by the DATA Act, ref. Req. 79.05, relatively short timeframe for implementation, and absense of new appropriations for agencies to carry out this work, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and other agencies <span class="priority">will</span> leverage existing practices that <span class="priority">will</span> better position the government to meet the statutory deadlines. For instance, agencies may meet the requirement for reporting agency-level financial data in the short run by using existing processes while other work is carried out to replace today's processes with data-centric reporting. Similarly, reporting award-level information <span class="priority">will</span> be facilitated through use of data sources (such as procurement data in the Federal Procurement Data SystemNext Generation (FPDS-NG)) that are matched with data in other locations. This approach promotes timeliness in reporting and provides an initial solution to challenges imposed by the absence of new funding streams.</p>
<p>During implementation, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> monitor the project�s progress and institute performance measures to ensure that it is on schedule and within budget. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> also assess risks regularly and mitigate them in a timely manner. To do so, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> provide periodic briefings to OMB, at its request, that detail the project�s progress.</p>
<p>E. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> reasonably assure suitable information and service quality, consistent with the level of importance of the information.</p>
<p>E1. Ongoing CIO engagement with program managers. The CIO <span class="priority">should</span> establish and maintain a process to regularly engage with program managers to evaluate IT resources supporting each agency strategic objective.  It <span class="priority">should</span> be the CIO and program managers� shared responsibility to ensure that legacy and on-going IT investments are appropriately delivering customer value and meeting the business objectives of programs. E2. Ongoing CIO engagement with program managers.  Program managers <span class="priority">shall</span> work with the CIO to define IT performance metrics and strategies to support fulfillment of agency strategic objectives defined in the agency�s strategic plan.</p>
<p>Each Agency CIO <span class="priority">will</span> be required to identify three �<span class="priority">must</span> move� services and create a project plan for migrating each of them to cloud solutions and retiring the associated legacy systems. Of the three, at least one of the services <span class="priority">must</span> fully migrate to a cloud solution within 12 months and the remaining two within 18 months. Each migration plan <span class="priority">will</span> include major milestones, execution risks, adoption targets, and required resources, as well as a retirement plan for legacy services once cloud services are online. These new cloud implementations <span class="priority">should</span> be compatible with the secure, certified platforms currently provided in the private sector.</p>
<p>Each Executive department or agency <span class="priority">shall</span>: <br /><br />i. Use FedRAMP when conducting risk assessments, security authorizations, and granting ATOs for all Executive department or agency use of cloud services; <br /><br />ii. Use the FedRAMP PMO process and the JAB-approved FedRAMP security authorization requirements as a baseline when initiating, reviewing, granting and revoking security authorizations for cloud services;10 <br /><br />iii. Ensure applicable contracts appropriately require CSPs to comply with FedRAMP security authorization requirements; <br /><br />iv. Establish and implement an incident response and mitigation capability for security and privacy incidents for cloud services in accordance with DHS guidance; <br /><br />v. Ensure that acquisition requirements address maintaining FedRAMP security authorization requirements and that relevant contract provisions related to contractor reviews and inspections are included for CSPs; <br /><br />vi. Consistent with DHS guidance, require that CSPs route their traffic such that the service meets the requirements of the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program; and <br /><br />vii. Provide to the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) annually on April 30, a certification in writing from the Executive department or agency CIO and Chief Financial Officer, a listing of all cloud services that an agency determines cannot meet the FedRAMP security authorization requirements with appropriate rationale and proposed resolutions.</p>
<p>Each Open Government Webpage <span class="priority">shall</span> incorporate a mechanism for the public to: i. Give feedback on and assessment of the quality of published information; ii.

Only through such partnerships will the United States be able to enhance cybersecurity and reap the full benefits of the digital revolution. The global challenge of securing cyberspace requires an increased effort in multilateral forums. This effort <span class="priority">should</span> seek�in continued collaboration with the private sector�to improve the security of interoperable networks through the development of global standards, expand the legal system�s capacity to combat cyber crime, continue to develop and promote best practices, and maintain stable and effective Internet governance.</p>
<p>Government <span class="priority">should</span> be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing. Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset. My Administration <span class="priority">will</span> take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use. Executive departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> harness new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public.</p>

<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�    include tiered pricing, or other appropriate strategies, to reduce prices as cumulative sales volume increases;</p>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�    require vendors to provide sufficient pricing, usage, and performance data to enable the government to improve their commodity management practices on an ongoing basis; and</p>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�  ensure that the Federal government gets credit for all sales provided under that vehicle, regardless of payment method, unless the sales are identified with other government contracts, so that volume-based pricing discounts can be applied;</p>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />� reflect input from a large number of potential agency users � especially the largest likely users � regarding customer demand for the goods and services being considered, the acquisition strategy (including contract pricing, delivery and other terms and conditions, and performance requirements), and the commodity management approach;</p>
<p>I <span class="priority">direct</span> the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services, to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies, within 120 days, of recommendations for an Open Government Directive, to be issued by the Director of OMB, that instructs executive departments and agencies to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in this memorandum.

<p>IT Acquisition Cadres. FITARA' s requirements for IT acquisition cadres builds upon OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) July 2011 memorandum on building specialized IT acquisition cadres.

The latest iteration of those Plans was due April 15, 2015. Additional guidance from OMB issued in February 2015 <span class="priority">requires</span> agencies to address new reporting elements required by FITARA. Details regarding these new reporting elements are found in Attachment F.</p>
<p>If a potential duplication is found [ref. Req. 44.13], the CIO <span class="priority">will</span> contact the managing partner of the initiative and the OMB E-Government Administrator for a recommendation on whether the agency acquisition should proceed or be cancelled by the agency and included in the E-Government Initiative.</p>
<p>If a procuring agency would like to fulfill a follow-on or renewable acquisition outside fo the 8(a) Program, it <span class="priority">must</span> make a written request to and receive the concurrence fo SBA in accordance with the regulations set for at 13 CFR 124.504(d).</p>
<p>If agencies fall under a nominal risk category, then the risk of noncompliance is low. Meeting the indicators for nominal risk signals that substantial compliance is adequately supported and additional supporting information should not be necessary. However, during the course of its financial statements audit, the financial statement auditor may request additional information to support compliance or, at its discretion, perform further testing. If agencies are under a significant risk category, then they are not in compliance with FFMIA and <span class="priority">must</span> identify remediation plans and resolve them. Agencies under moderate risk <span class="priority">may need</span> to provide further information to support compliance. Specific guidance may be found in the FFMIA Implementation Guide of 2008. [see page 7 for diagram]</p>
<p>Importantly, OMB and agencies <span class="priority">must</span> evaluate the way in which IT programs are reviewed so that budget approval for large IT programs is tied to key implementation steps rather than seemingly upfront, wholesale approval of massive programs.� OMB <span class="priority">will</span> evaluate ways to ensure agencies can demonstrate strong performance in earlier modules in order to receive approval for funding of subsequent modules.</p>
<p>In November 2007, OMB announced the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative to optimize individual agency network services into a common solution for the Federal government. Agencies were required to develop and submit comprehensive Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to reduce and consolidate the number of external access points, including Internet connections; and ensure that all external connections are routed through an OMBapproved TIC. <br /><br />Based on solicited agency Statements of Capability, OMB also designated twenty agencies as TIC Access Providers (TICAPS). Each TICAP agency was authorized two locations where they <span class="priority">must</span> reduce and consolidate all external connections. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> present an evidence-based rationale for acquisition of more than two locations. Please send an email to tic@dhs.gov for the template and instructions.</p>
<p>In accordance with FISMA 2014 (Section 301, 44 U.S.C � 3554), agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> submit an annual report to OMB, DHS, and the appropriate committees.</p>
<p>In accordance with FITARA, beginning in fiscal year 2016, each agency head <span class="priority">shall</span> annually publish a Strategic Plan to describe the agency's consolidation and optimization strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018.</p>
<p>In accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum 10-28, �Clarifying Cybersecurity Responsibilities and Activities of the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Homeland Security,� DHS <span class="priority">will</span> continue to exercise primary responsibility within the Executive branch for the operational aspects of Federal agency cybersecurity with respect to the Federal information systems that fall within the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) (Title III, Pub. L. No. 107-347). Within the operational framework of FedRAMP, DHS activities <span class="priority">will</span> include: <br />i. Assisting government-wide and agency-specific efforts to provide adequate, risk-based and cost-effective cybersecurity; <br />ii. Coordinating cybersecurity operations and incident response and providing appropriate assistance; <br />iii. Developing continuous monitoring standards for ongoing cybersecurity of Federal information systems to include real-time monitoring and continuously verified operating configurations; <br />iv. Developing guidance on agency implementation of the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program with cloud services.</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring PMs are appropriately qualified, this quarter's e-Gov management scorecard requires agencies to submit to OMB by July 30th, a plan to meet (i.e., implement and achieve) the CIO Council guidance [issued in the FY 2005 Budget Guidance]. Your plans <span class="priority">should</span> document your approach, milestones and schedule for meeting budget guidance. Further, the plans <span class="priority">should</span> be coordinated with your Chief Human Capital Officers, please follow OPM�s Workforce Planning Model (www.opm.gov/workforceplanning/) and the OPM Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (http://apps.opm.gov/HumanCapital/tool/index.cfm). <span class="other">Complete</span> the attached summary table as part of your plan.</p>
<p>In alignment with the Administration�s core IT objectives, PortfolioStat sessions <span class="priority">will</span> focus on three key areas: (1) driving value in Federal IT investments, (2) delivering world-class digital services, and (3) protecting Federal IT assets and information.  Prior to each quarterly PortfolioStat session, agencies <span class="priority">will</span> be provided a scorecard including agency-specific performance metric data (see Fiscal Year 2015 PortfolioStat Performance Metrics below for specific metrics) and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>
<p>In analyzing potential risks, the agency <span class="priority">must</span> consider all of the potential direct and indirect results of an authentication failure, including the possibility that there will be more than one failure, or harms to more than one person.  The definitions of potential impacts contain some relative terms, like "serious" or "minor," whose meaning will depend on context.  The agency should consider the context and the nature of the persons or entities affected to decide the relative significance of these harms.  Over time, the meaning of these terms will become more definite as agencies gain practical experience with these issues.  The analysis of harms to agency programs or other public interests depends strongly on the context; the agency should consider these issues with care.</p>
<p>In determining whether a Major Incident has occurred, agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> consider whether the incident:  <br />1) Involves information that is Classified, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)  proprietary, CUI Privacy, or CUI Other; <br />2) Is not recoverable, not recoverable within a specified amount of time, or is recoverable only with supplemental resources; and <br />3) Has a high or medium functional impact to the mission of an agency; Or <br />4) Involves the exfiltration, modification, deletion or unauthorized access or lack of availability to information or systems within certain parameters to include either:  a) A specific threshold of number of records or users affected; 10,000 or more records or 10,000 or more users affected ; or  b) Any record of special importance.</p>
<p>In developing their public access plans, [ref. Req. 90.01-90.02] agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> seek to put in place policies that enhance innovation and competitiveness by maximizing the potential to create new business opportunities and are otherwise consistent with the principles articulated in section 1.</p>
<p>In general, agencies <span class="priority">will</span> not be exempt from any part of the policy. However, there <span class="priority">may</span> be two exceptions given a legitimate need: (1) deviation from the standard configurations (see Section 6.E [page 4]; and (2) exception to competition when upgrading or modernizing core financial systems (see Section 7.D). [page 6]</p>
<p>In order to facilitate timely and effective IPv6 adoption, agencies <span class="priority">shall</span>: <br />-Upgrade public/external facing servers and services (e.g. web, email, DNS, ISP services, etc) to operationally use native IPv6 by the end of FY 2012; <br />-Upgrade internal client applications that communicate with public Internet servers and supporting enterprise networks to operationally use native IPv6 by the end of FY 2014; <br />-Designate an IPv6 Transition Manager and submit their name, title, and contact information to IPv6@omb.eop.gov by October 30, 2010. The IPv6 Transition Manager is to serve as the person responsible for leading the agency�s IPv6 transition activities, and liaison with the wider Federal IPv6 effort as necessary; and, <br />Ensure agency procurements of networked IT comply with FAR requirements for use of the USGv6 Profile and Test Program for the completeness and quality of their IPv6 capabilities.</p>
<p>In order to support agencies and appropriations staff in leveraging budget flexibility, the Federal CFO Council, in collaboration with the Federal CIO Council, <span class="priority">will</span> develop a set of best practices and materials that explain the need for these types of funding, and prescribe a path to achieving more flexible models. <br />As a first step, the Federal CIO Council <span class="priority">will</span> create a segmentation of common IT program types and the associated funding requirements. The Federal CFO Council <span class="priority">will</span> then work with the Federal CIO Council to create detailed �playbooks� mapping each IT program type to specific budget vehicles based on examples of past investments and IT needs (e.g., multi-year funding for programs with several discrete deliverables).</p>
<p>In particular, the guidance [issued by OFPP] <span class="priority">will</span> focus on increasing cross-functional knowledge of the IT marketplace, IT program management, and IT acquisition. OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> build upon its current Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) to develop a path for IT expertise. OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> leverage existing curriculum that may exist within agencies that already host specialized IT acquisition professionals. Skills development <span class="priority">will</span> include:<br />� Classroom training: OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> leverage and strengthen, where necessary, existing classes at the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), and engage these and other training providers to develop additional offerings as necessary.<br />� On-the-job experience: As is true with acquisition in general, the skills needed to successfully handle large IT acquisitions call for a blend of classroom training and on-the-job experience. For example, contracting professionals with hands-on IT experience are better equipped to help IT and program staff translate business and technical requirements into a statement of work that can help ensure a smooth procurement.<br />� Mentorship: Building a strong culture of mentorship enables IT acquisition professionals to more quickly learn �the art of the possible� to deliver effective IT acquisition solutions. OFPP can encourage this by building on FAI�s ongoing efforts to foster mentorship and networking opportunities, within and between agencies.</p>
<p>In the long term, all agencies <span class="priority">should</span> continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers <span class="priority">are required</span> to be closed before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as temporary and work to close them.</p>
<p>In the next six months, OPM <span class="priority">will</span> work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for IT PMs as necessary.</p>
<p>In the next six months, OPM, with input from agencies and OMB, <span class="priority">will</span> create a specialized career path for IT program managers (PMs). This <span class="priority">will</span> likely require creating a separate Occupational Series specific to IT program management within the current IT family with career advancement paths that are more competitive with the private sector. The path <span class="priority">should</span> require expertise and experience for advancement. It <span class="priority">will</span> also require the development of a competency model for IT program management consistent with the IT project manager model. [...] In the next six months, OPM <span class="priority">will</span> work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for IT PMs as necessary.</p>
<p>In view of the benefits from enterprise licensing, each agency is asked to assist and support the SmartBUY initiative. Specifically, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> participate in SmartBUY by: Developing a migration strategy and taking contractual actions as needed to move to the government-wide license agreements as quickly as practicable;</p>
<p>In view of the benefits from enterprise licensing, each agency is asked to assist and support the SmartBUY initiative. Specifically, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> participate in SmartBUY by: Integrating agency common desktop and server software licenses under the leadership of the SmartBUY team. This includes refraining, to the maximum extent feasible, from renewing or entering into new license agreements without prior consultation with, and consideration of the views of, the SmartBUY team.</p>
<p>In view of the benefits from enterprise licensing, each agency is asked to assist and support the SmartBUY initiative. Specifically, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> participate in SmartBUY by: Providing information and input on existing agreements, current prices, unique terms and conditions, and future needs for relevant software. The SmartBUY team is collecting this information, using a web-based survey, for consideration in an overall acquisition strategy;</p>
<p>Incorporate new interoperability and openness requirements into core agency processes Consistent with 44 U.S.C. 3506 (b)(2), agencies <span class="priority">must</span> develop and maintain an Information Resource Management (IRM) Strategic Plan. IRM Strategic Plans should align with the agency' s Strategic Plan (as required by OMB Circular A-ll ), support the attainment of agency priority goals as mandated by the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010, provide a description of how IRM activities help accomplish agency missions, and ensure that IRM decisions are integrated with organizational planning, budget, procurement, financial management, human resources management, and program decisions. As part of the annual PortfolioStat process, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> update their IRM Strategic Plans to describe how they are meeting new and existing information life cycle management requirements. Specifically, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> describe how they have institutionalized and operationalized the interoperability and openness requirements in this Memorandum into their core processes across all applicable agency programs and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Inexpensive, efficient solutions such as these <span class="priority">should be</span> made available to all agencies to effectively tap the understanding of industry partners, especially in the period prior to issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP). Within the next six months, GSA <span class="priority">will</span> launch a government-wide, online, interactive platform for this purpose.</p>
<p>Interim Financial Statements. Agencies <span class="priority"><span class="action">will submit</span></span> unaudited interim financial statements to OMB 21 business days after the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year.<br /><br />Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> include management�s explanation of significant variances in types or amounts of assets, liabilities, costs, revenues, obligations, and outlays along with their financial statements (see Section IV.3 [page 170] for details). Also, see item 5 of Section IV.3 for details for the additional required analysis between the Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) and the Report on Budget Execution (SF 133) due to OMB 45 calendar days after the end of third quarter and year-end.</p>
<p>Interim Reports. Agencies <span class="priority">are required</span> to use the MAX Federal Community to submit their interim financial statements to OMB (See Appendix B). To access the MAX Federal Community request a MAX ID at https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/registrationForm.do . MAX IDs are open to any Executive branch government employee or contractor supporting a government organization using the MAX Federal Community. Specific procedures for using the MAX Federal Community to submit draft and final reports are located at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/hJn1Iw.<br /><br />Draft Reports. Agencies <span class="priority">are required</span> to submit their draft reports (i.e., PARs, AFRs, Annual Management Reports, etc.) to OMB electronically (using the MAX Federal Community).<br /><br />Final Reports. Offices of the CFO <span class="priority">should</span> submit their final reports (i.e., PARs, AFRs, Annual Management Reports, etc.) to OMB (using the MAX Federal Community), Treasury (Main), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) using the contact information provided in Appendix B. Furthermore, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> submit their final reports to Congress.1 Reports are final when their electronic files include all required signatures.</p>
<p>It <span class="other">is critical</span> that the agency CIO retain accountability for the roles and responsibilities identified in the Common Baseline.  As agency environments vary considerably, CIOs <span class="priority">may</span> find that decisions about some IT resources included in the Common Baseline <span class="priority">may</span> be more appropriately executed by other agency officials, such as a bureau CIO or even parts of program or procurement communities.  This <span class="priority">must</span> be done in a way to allow the agency CIO to retain accountability.</p>
<p>J1.  CIO role in recommending modification, termination, or pause of IT projects or initiatives. The CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> conduct TechStat reviews or use other applicable performance measurements to evaluate the use of the IT resources of the agency.  The CIO <span class="priority">may</span> recommend to the agency head the modification, pause, or termination of any acquisition, investment, or activity that includes a significant IT component based on the CIO's evaluation, within the terms of the relevant contracts and applicable regulations.</p>
<p>K1 . CIO review and approval  of acquisition  strategy and  acquisition  plan . Agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> not approve an acquisition strategy or acquisition plan (as described in FAR Part 724) or interagency agreement (such as those used to support purchases through another agency) that includes IT without review and approval by the agency CIO.  For contract actions that contain IT without an approved acquisition strategy or acquisition plan , the CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> review and approve the action itself.The CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> primarily consider the following factors when reviewing acquisition strategies and acquisition plans: Appropriateness contract type; Appropriateness of IT related portions of statement of needs or statement of work; Appropriateness of above with respect to the mission and business objectives supported by the IT strategic plan; and Alignment with mission and program objectives in consultation with program leadership. K2. CAO <span class="priority">is responsible for</span> ensuring contract actions that contain IT a re consistent with CIO� approved acquisition strategies and plans. The CAO <span class="priority">shall</span> indicate to the CIO when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT. The CAO <span class="priority">shall</span> ensure the agency <span class="priority">shall</span> initiate no contract actions or interagency agreements that include IT unless they are reviewed and approved by the CIO or are consistent with the acquisition strategy and acquisition plan previously approved by the CIO. Similar process for contract modifications. CAO <span class="priority">shall</span> also ensure that no modifications that make substantial changes to the scope of a significant contract are approved that are inconsistent with the acquisition  strategy and acquisition plan  previously approved by the CIO unless the modification is reviewed and approved by the CIO.</p>
<p>L1. CIO approval of reprogramming. The CIO <span class="priority">must</span> approve any movement of funds for IT resources that requires Congressional notification. L2. CIO approval of reprogramming.  The CFO <span class="priority">shall</span> ensure any notifications under L1 are approved by the CIO prior to submission to OMB.</p>
<p>Leadership and accountability <span class="priority">must</span> extend throughout the Federal government. Including cybersecurity among the President�s management priorities and assessing the progress of departments and agencies against stated goals <span class="other">would</span> provide additional means to ensure accountability and progress. The cybersecurity policy official�in consultation with NSC [National Security Council], OMB, NEC [National Economic Council], and OSTP�<span class="other">would</span> define the milestones and success criteria and raise the visibility of cybersecurity within all agency budgets.</p>
<p>M1. CIO approves bureau CIOs. The CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> be involved in the recruitment and <span class="priority">shall</span> approve the selection of any new bureau CIO (includes bureau leadership with CJO duties but not title-see definitions). The title and responsibilities of current bureau CIOs <span class="priority">may</span> be designated or transferred to other agency personnel by the  agency head or his or her designee as appropriate, and such decisions <span class="priority">may</span> take into consideration recommendation s from the agency CIO.</p>
<p>Managing partners of shared services <span class="priority">will</span> assess the current state of shared services and each release a roadmap to improve quality and uptake. Ultimately, the managing partners <span class="priority">will</span> be responsible for executing these roadmaps and <span class="priority">will</span> be held accountable for improvements on SLAs and reductions in cost. These efforts <span class="priority">will</span> enable the current shared services to be accessible government-wide at higher quality levels.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Federal IT programs <span class="priority">must</span> be structured to deploy working business functionality in release cycles no longer than 12 months, and, ideally, less than six months, with initial deployment to end users no later than 18 months after the program begins.</p>
<p>Moving forward, agencies will be <span class="priority">required</span> to provide explanatory language within CyberScope for any FISMA metric that does not meet established CAP Goal targets.  While there is no minimum length requirement for each comment, agencies are encouraged to provide as much information as needed to best explain their program and progress.</p>
<p>N1. CIO role in ongoing bureau CIOs' evaluations. The CHCO and CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> jointly establish an agency-wide critical element (or elements) included in all bureau CIOs' performance evaluations.  In cases where the bureau CIO is a member of the Senior Executive Service and the agency uses the Basic SES Appraisal System, this critical element(s) is an "agency-specific performance requirement " in the Executive Performance Plan. Each such agency <span class="priority">may</span> determine that critical element(s) (ECQs) contain these requirements. For agencies that do not use the Basic SES Appraisal System or for bureau CIOs who are not members of the SES, then these <span class="priority">shall</span> be critical elements in their evaluations.The [agency] CIO <span class="priority">must</span> identify "key bureau CIOs" and provide input to the rating official for this critical element(s) for at least all "key bureau CIOs" at the time of the initial summary rating and for any required progress reviews. The rating official <span class="priority">will</span> consider the input from the [agency] CIO when determining the initial summary rating and discusses it with the bureau CIO during progress reviews. N2. CIO role in ongoing bureau CIOs' evaluations.  The CHCO and CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> jointly establish an agency-wide critical element (or elements) for the evaluation of bureau CIOs as described in N1.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Directive <span class="priority">shall</span> be construed to supersede existing requirements for review and clearance of pre-decisional information by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to legislative, budgetary, administrative, and regulatory materials. Moreover, nothing in this Directive <span class="priority">shall</span> be construed to suggest that the presumption of openness precludes the legitimate protection of information whose release would threaten national security, invade personal privacy, breach confidentiality, or damage other genuinely compelling interests.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Memorandum <span class="priority">shall</span> be construed to affect existing requirements for review and clearance of pre-decisional information by OMB relating to legislative, budgetary, administrative, and regulatory materials. Moreover, nothing in this Memorandum <span class="priority">shall</span> be construed to reduce the protection of information whose release would threaten national security, invade personal privacy, breach confidentiality or contractual terms, violate the Trade Secrets Act, violate other statute confidentiality requirements, or damage other compelling interests. This Memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p>O1. Bureau IT Leadership Directory. CIO and CHCO <span class="priority">will</span> conduct a survey of all bureau CIOs and CIO and CHCO <span class="priority">will</span> jointly publish a dataset identifying all bureau officials with title of CIO or duties of a CIO. This <span class="priority">shall</span> be posted as a public dataset based on instruction s in the IDC by August 15, 2015 and kept up- to- date thereafter. The report <span class="priority">will</span> identify for each: Employment type (e.g. GS, SES, SL, ST, etc.) Type of appointment (e.g. career, appointed, etc.) Other responsibilities (e.g. full-time CIO or combination CIO/CFO. Evaluation "rating official" (e.g. bureau head, other official) Evaluation "reviewing official" (if used) Whether [agency) C!O identifies this bureau CIO as a "key bureau CIO" and thus <span class="priority">requires</span> the [agency] CIO to provide the rating official input into the agency-wide critical element(s) described in N1. O2. Bureau IT Leadership Directory. CHCO <span class="priority">will</span> work with CIO to develop the Bureau IT Leadership Directory as described in OI .</p>
<p>OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> identify the major myths that most significantly hinder requirements definition and the development of effective acquisition planning and execution. In January 2011, OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> issue a memorandum identifying these myths and the related facts and strategies to improve constructive engagement. This effort <span class="priority">will</span> be supported through discussions and other outreach efforts with key stakeholders in early 2011 including, but not limited to:<br />� Professional associations and other industry representatives.<br />� Federal stakeholders including program managers, contracting professionals, agency attorneys, and ethics officials.</p>
<p>OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> lead an effort over the next six months to study the experience of those agencies that have already created specialized IT acquisition teams, in order to develop a model to scale more broadly.</p>
<p>OGP [Office of Government-wide Policy], in consultation with the Unified Shared Services Management office, <span class="priority">shall</span> establish and maintain a data center shared services marketplace and coordinate shared services for inter-agency consumption by:<br />� Coordinating with OMB to define qualifying operating standards for inter-agency shared services providers, creating guidance materials for becoming such a provider, and identifying and approving candidate providers.</p>
<p>OMB directs agencies, consistent with applicable law, to <span class="action">provide</span> the following to DHS by emailing rta@us-cert.gov by November 13, 2015:  <br />� A standing Federal Network Authorization. <span class="priority">Ensure</span> that such an authorization is reviewed on a semiannual basis and remains on file with DHS and will be activated by an email from the victim agency to DHS at the time of an incident;</p>
<p>OMB is reforming the certification process by shifting the accountability for software performance to the vendor through self-certification. To the extent software functionality does not perform in accordance with vendor certification, the Federal agency <span class="priority">will</span> hold the vendor accountable in the same manner in which other contractual obligations are enforced, such as through the imposing of liquidated damages, requiring repair or replacement, or terminating the contract. If the contractor is found to have made any materially false or fraudulent statements or representations, it may be subject to penalties under the False Statement Act. This should make contractors clearly accountable for delivering what they promise. OMB <span class="priority">will</span>, as appropriate, revisit this policy on an annual basis to determine the potential need for refinement. Additional details related to this change to the testing process <span class="priority">will</span> be provided in an upcoming revision to OMB CircularA-127, scheduled to be issued this summer, as well as the OMB Audit Bulletin.</p>
<p>OMB <span class="priority">shall</span> be notified of all governance boards the CIO is a member of via IDC - By August 30, 2015 and kept up to date thereafter via IDC.</p>
<p>OMB supports shared service arrangements when cost effective, but <span class="priority">will</span> no longer mandate them in all cases for financial management systems. Past attempts to mandate use of financial management shared services yielded inconsistent results, as medium and large agencies encountered the same types of costs and risks with a shared service provider as they did when modernizing �in house.� These risks, along with early reluctance by Federal agencies to fully leverage the shared service model, led agencies to pursue shared service arrangements for low impact areas in terms of operational efficiency, such as common hosting, and to defer higher impact areas, such as common transaction processing. OMB expects the requirements to re-scope agency modernization projects contained in this guidance <span class="priority">will</span> enable greater adoption of shared service arrangements with lower risk and greater cost impacts. Further, financial management shared service efforts <span class="priority">will</span> now focus on the higher impact area of transaction processing. OMB, Department of the Treasury, and the CFO Council <span class="priority">will</span> identify the development of common automated solutions for transaction processing. The Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation, which has been recently established within Treasury�s Fiscal Service, <span class="priority">will</span> pilot these solutions. The first priorities <span class="priority">will</span> be to develop initial operating capabilities for vendor invoicing and intergovernmental transactions. Existing shared service relationships <span class="priority">will</span> remain unchanged, but agencies that are being cross-serviced can re-evaluate whether the current and future relationship remains cost-effective.</p>
<p>OMB <span class="priority">will</span>  provide instructions to agencies, including a schema, at https://management.cio.gov/schema within 5 days of the issuance of this memorandum.</p>
<p>OMB <span class="priority">will</span> launch a publicly available dashboard to serve as a window into progress of the data center consolidation program.</p>
<p>OMB <span class="priority">will</span> measure agency progress for this initiative [data center optimization] using the following optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies' quarterly data center inventory submissions. These optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all data centers at agency facilities.</p>
<p>OMB <span class="priority">will</span> review revised project plans within 60 days of submission. This review may include presentation of plans to the Board for its evaluation and recommendations, but OMB <span class="priority">will</span> make the final decision regarding approval of a revised project plan. Many agencies have already begun working on revised project plans. Attachment B includes an initial schedule of review dates for these projects.</p>
<p>OMB, in coordination with Treasury, <span class="priority">will</span> contact Federal agencies during May 2015 with specific information regarding any necessary changes to existing implementation plans required under prior OMB guidance. Agency points of contact <span class="priority">will</span> be Senior Accountable Officials (SAOs), or Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) where an SAO has not been identified. Plan revisions <span class="priority"><span class="definition">must include</span></span> designation of an SAO who is a senior official in the agency with the ability to coordinate across multiple communities and Federal Lines of Business (LOBs), in accordance with M-10-06, Open Government Directive.</p>
<p>OPM <span class="priority">will</span> work with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pilot the IT program management career track.</p>
<p>OSTP <span class="priority">will</span> oversee implementation [of Policy 90, the creation of public access plans, ref. Req. 90.01-90.02] through regular meetings with agencies.</p>
<p>OSTP, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), <span class="priority">will</span> review the draft agency plans [ref. Req. 90.01-90.02] and provide guidance to facilitate the development of final plans that are consistent with the objectives of this memorandum and, where possible, compatible with the plans of other Federal agencies subject to this memorandum.</p>
<p>Once a plan is established, an agency <span class="priority">must</span> obtain approval from its Investment Review Board (IRB) if major changes are needed. The approved financial management systems plan will provide a basis for the agency�s business case. The business case <span class="priority">must</span> include an estimate of the full cost necessary to complete the upgrade, and have considered different alternatives in measuring the risks and costs for the plan. The business case will be used to justify funding and, therefore, <span class="priority">must</span> be clearly stated in the agency�s budget request. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> communicate progress against the approved business case and financial management systems plan with OMB throughout the financial management system lifecycle. A summary of the plan <span class="priority"><span class="priority">should</span> be</span> included in the agency�s annual financial report as instructed in OMB Circular No A-136, �Financial Reporting Requirements.� For agencies not covered under the CFO Act, they need to prepare the plans but are not required to report them in their annual financial reports.</p>
<p>Once cemented at the agency level, the "TechStat" model <span class="priority">will</span> be deployed at the bureau-level to ensure the effective management of large programs. Within 18 months, Agency CIOs, in collaboration with other agency leaders, <span class="priority">will</span> be responsible for deploying the tools and training necessary to ensure rollout has been completed.</p>
<p>Once established, agencies <span class="priority">shall not</span> issue new solicitations for these requirements unless they have developed a business case, approved by the agency�s CIO and shared with OMB, to establish that the separate procurement of these needs results in better value, considering price and other appropriate factors.</p>
<p>Over the longer term, the General Services Administration (GSA) <span class="priority">will</span> also provide government-wide services to share best practices and assist agencies in developing guidelines for issuing challenges.  Additionally, GSA <span class="priority">will</span> develop, as expeditiously as possible, a contract vehicle to provide agency access to relevant products and services, including technical assistance in structuring and conducting contests to take maximum benefit of the marketplace as they identify and pursue contest initiatives to further the policy objectives of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> issue guidance requiring an IPT [Integrated Program Teams], led by a dedicated, full-time program manager and supported by an IT acquisition specialist, be in place for all major IT programs before OMB <span class="priority">will</span> approve program budgets.[...] For major IT investments, agency leadership <span class="priority">will</span> approve the composition of the integrated program team and the dedicated program manager.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> work with Congress to analyze existing working capital funds (WCFs) and other vehicles for pooling funds and extending availability of funding.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the Federal CIO, with input from agencies, <span class="priority">will</span> design a specialized IT acquisition cadre.</p>
<p>Over the next year, OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> work with the acquisition and IT communities to develop guidance on contracting for modular development. As part of this effort, OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> hold an open meeting with industry leaders to solicit ideas/feedback on contracting for modular development. OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> develop templates and samples, and <span class="priority">will</span> create communities of practice to facilitate adoption of modular contracting practices.</p>
<p>P1. IT Workforce. The CIO and CHCO <span class="priority">will</span>  develop a set of competency requirements for IT staff, including IT leadership positions, and develop and maintain a current workforce planning process to ensure the department/agency can (a) anticipate and respond to changing mission requirements, (b) maintain workforce skills in a rapidly developing IT environment , and (c) recruit and retain the IT talent needed to accomplish the mission . P2. IT Workforce. CIO and CHCO-- and CAO where relevant-- <span class="priority">shall</span> develop a set of competency requirements for IT staff, including IT leadership positions, and develop and maintain a current workforce planning process to ensure the department/agency can (a) anticipate and respond to changing mission requirements, (b) maintain workforce skills in a rapidly developing IT environment, and (c) recruit and retain the IT talent needed to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p>PARs, AFRs, and Annual Management Reports. Agencies and Government Corporations <span class="priority"><span class="action">will submit</span></span> their final Performance and Accountability Reports (PAR), Agency Financial Reports (AFR), or Annual Management Reports (as described in the Government Corporations Control Act) to OMB, GAO, and the Congress by 6 p.m. EST on November 15th of the fiscal year following the fiscal year that is being reported. If November 15th falls on the weekend or holiday, the due date will automatically move to the next business day. Agencies and Government Corporations <span class="priority"><span class="action">will submit</span></span> a draft of the PAR, AFR, or Annual Management Reports to OMB�s Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) and the appropriate Resource Management Office (RMO) 10 working days before issuing the final PAR, AFR, or Annual Management Report. This draft <span class="priority">should</span> include all sections of the PAR, AFR, or Annual Management Report except the audit report if it is not available at that time. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> provide their draft audit report to OMB as soon as it is available. The final reports <span class="priority">should</span> be posted to the agencies� website the same day the report is submitted to OMB, GAO, and the Congress. If on this day a report is not compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d), the agency <span class="priority">must</span> post the 508-compliant version of the final report to its website no later than 15 calendar days later. The final report�s website location <span class="priority">must</span> be clearly identified on the agency�s homepage.</p>
<p>Part 2 includes eGov/LoB and Unified Shared Services Management designated shared services. Previously required Part 4: Grants Management <span class="priority">should</span> be included in Part 2. Part 5: National Security Systems <span class="priority">should</span> be aligned against the appropriate Part above and will be delineated using investment type identifiers.<br /><br />Per section 51.3, your justification materials <span class="priority">should</span> include a section beginning with the words "IT Resource Statements" that provides the following: a statement from the CIO affirming that the CIO has reviewed and approved the major IT investments portion of your budget request; a statement from the CFO and CIO affirming that the CIO had a significant role in reviewing planned IT support for major program objectives and significant increases and decreases in IT resources; and a statement from the CIO and CFO that the IT Portfolio includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the budget request. If for any reason any of the above is not accurate, briefly describe the nature of the inaccuracy. The above statements and discussion <span class="priority">must</span> also be included in your agency's annual assurance statement described in OMB Circular A-123.</p>
<p>Part of this program <span class="priority">will</span> include well-designed, well-managed continuous monitoring and standardized risk assessment processes, to be supported by "CyberStat" sessions run by the Department ofHomeland Security to examine implementation.</p>
<p>Per FAR Subpart 34.2 and OMB�s Capital Programming Guide, a supplement to Circular A-11, Part 7, agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> implement an Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) or baseline validation process as part of an overall investment risk management strategy. As part of this process, requested adjustments to an existing investment baseline (i.e. �rebaselining�) should only be made if the program manager can demonstrate a high probability of success and a benefit-cost result that justifies continued funding after comparison with the other alternatives in the portfolio and budget limitations. Agency policy <span class="priority">shall</span> address: (I) establishing an investment baseline; (II) rebaselining an investment; (III) notifying OMB of new and changed baselines; (IV) managing and monitoring baselines via the use of performance management systems, (V) Federal IT Dashboard reporting requirements; and (VI) policy specific for Major IT Programs of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Phase 1 [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Preparation.  Following each quarterly agency IDC submission, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> analyze the latest data, consider trends in performance metrics over time, and review past PortfolioStat topics and PortfolioStat action items to identify topics for the upcoming PortfolioStat session�s discussion.  OMB <span class="priority">will</span> send these topics, analysis, and proposed agenda for each agency to the agency�s PortfolioStat lead.  Agencies <span class="priority">are encouraged</span> to work closely with OMB to provide clarifications and improvements to the preparation prior to the quarterly PortfolioStat session.</p>
<p>Phase 2  [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Session. Agency PortfolioStat leads <span class="priority">shall</span> work with OMB to schedule a PortfolioStat session to be held within eight weeks following the relevant IDC quarter�s submission deadline.  In the session, OMB and the agency CIO <span class="priority">will</span> review updates to the agency's Strategic IRM Plan and Enterprise Roadmap, trending data from the agency�s IDC and IT Dashboard submissions, discuss preceding quarterly PortfolioStat action items, status of investments included in High Impact Program(s), and select performance metrics. Based on the discussion, OMB and the agency <span class="priority">will</span> identify and agree on PortfolioStat action items (with specific deadlines) which OMB <span class="priority">will</span> send to the agency within two weeks of the completed session. Where appropriate, results from these sessions <span class="priority">shall</span> be integrated into agency budget submissions and Congressional Budget Justifications.</p>
<p>Phase 3  [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Post-Session. Upon receipt of PortfolioStat action items, agency PortfolioStat leads <span class="priority">shall</span> work with OMB to include updates on the status of these items in the next quarterly PortfolioStat.  Agencies that do not meet a deadline identified in a PortfolioStat action item <span class="priority">shall</span> brief the Federal CIO and the agency head at least once per quarter until the action item is complete. Agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> describe progress implementing each PortfolioStat action item as a part of quarterly IDC reporting. At least once per year, agency heads <span class="priority">shall</span> review with the agency CIO and certify that the reported status of each PortfolioStat action item is accurate and send this certification to OMB.</p>
<p>Private and secure connections are becoming the Internet's baseline, as expressed by the policies ofthe Internet's standards bodies, popular web browsers, and the Internet community of practice. The Federal government <span class="priority">must</span> adapt to this changing landscape, and benefits by beginning the conversion now. Proactive investment at the Federal level will support faster internet-wide adoption and promote better privacy standards for the entire browsing public.</p>
<p>Private sector-provided cloud services <span class="other">are not</span> considered data centers for the purposes of this memorandum, but <span class="priority">must</span> continue to be included in agencies' quarterly inventory data submissions to OMB.</p>
<p>Procurement data, as provided to USAspending.gov from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS-NG or Integrated Award Environment successor), <span class="priority">shall</span> follow existing regulatory requirements for reporting and annual verification and validation.</p>
<p>Program managers <span class="priority">need to</span> define each phase of the IT development lifecycle and rigorously manage scope. These timelines <span class="priority">should</span> encompass the entire process -- from concept through requirement analysis, development, test, and delivery.</p>
<p>Q1. CIO reports to agency  head  (or deputy/COO). As required  by  the Clinger Cohen Act and left in place by FITARA, the CIO "<span class="priority">shall</span> report directly to such agency head to carry out the responsibilities of the agency under this subchapter."This provision  remains unchanged, though certain agencies have since implemented legislation  under which the CIO and other management officials report to a COO, Undersecretary for Management, Assistant Secretary for Administration, or similar management executive ; in these cases, to remain consistent with the Clinger Cohen requirement as left unchanged by FITARA, the CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> have direct access to the agency head (i.e., the Secretary, or Deputy Secretary serving on the Secretary's behalf) regarding programs that include information technology .</p>
<p>Quarterly PortfolioStat activities <span class="priority">will</span> take place in three phases: (1) Preparation; (2) Session; and (3) Post-Session. The following [ref. Reqs. 81.77 - 81.79] provides details on each phase with guidance on the schedule and requirements to ensure PortfolioStat is consistently implemented.</p>
<p>Roles and Responsibilities- The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 assigns agency CIOs statutory responsibility for promoting the effective and efficient design and operation of all major IRM processes within their agency. Accordingly, agency heads <span class="priority">must</span> ensure that CIOs are positioned with the responsibility and authority to implement the requirements of this Memorandum in coordination with the agency's Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Senior Agency Official for Geospatial Information, Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP), Chief lnformation Security Officer (CISO), Senior Agency Official for Records Management, and Chief Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Officer. The CIO should also work with the agency's public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners and other leadership, as applicable.</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�          propose other savings strategies that could be implemented, such as adapting existing vehicles (e.g., Multiple Award Schedules, GWACs, and Multi-agency Contracts) to ensure that certain characteristics of strategic sourcing are followed.</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�        propose vendor management or other strategies that could be used to reduce the variability in the prices paid for similar goods and services, where the development of new government-wide vehicles may not be immediately feasible; and</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�       propose plans and management strategies to maximize the use of each strategic sourcing effort;</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�     identify agencies that should serve as "executive agents" to lead the development of each of these new solutions (with the assistance of interagency teams comprised of agency experts);</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�    identify at least five products and/or services for which new government-wide acquisition vehicles or management approaches should be developed and made mandatory, to the maximum extent practicable, for the SSLC agencies;</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�    identify existing contract vehicles and relevant contract renewal dates that could be used to develop transition strategies to the new solutions;</p>
<p>SSLC recommendations <span class="priority">shall</span>:  <br />�   for these identified commodities and solutions, provide a supporting spend analysis, estimate savings opportunities, and define metrics for tracking progress;</p>
<p>Second, concurrent with this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is <span class="priority">directing</span> executive departments and agencies to refrain from awarding new task orders or contracts for financial system modernization projects � an area of persistent problems � pending review and approval by OMB. This guidance specifies the timing and parameters of the review process, including specific rules designed to significantly reduce the size, cost, and complexity of financial system modernization projects.</p>
<p>Sections I through V of this memo are not applicable to the Department of Defense (DoD). Where applicable, DoD will follow the requirements of title 10, United States Code and corresponding DoD acquisition policy regarding the establishment of, and revisions to, baselines for IT investments.</p>
<p>Sharing with the public and Congress. As required by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235)10 OMB <span class="priority">will</span> continue to report quarterly to Congress on the cost savings, avoidance, and reductions in duplicative IT investments resulting from the above agency efforts. OMB <span class="priority">will</span> also provide a summary of these savings by agency on a publicly accessible website. Agency reporting requirements for these topics are included in the IDC instructions.</p>
<p>Some agencies have authority to award grants and/or participate in cooperative agreements and may be able conduct prize competitions though that authority. A �grant� is defined in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (and in OMB Circulars) as financial assistance by the Federal Government that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose; a �cooperative agreement� is similarly defined, with the additional criterion that the agency expects to have substantial involvement with the recipient in carrying out the activities contemplated in the agreement. Neither instrument may be used to acquire goods or services for the direct use or benefit of the Federal Government, such as to conduct an agency�s own prize contest; agencies <span class="priority">must</span> use procurement contracts for that purpose.</p>
<p>Standardized cost savings metrics and performance indicators. As a part of the IDC reporting requirements, agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> continue to provide cost savings and cost avoidance achieved as a result of strategies that the agency has decided to adopt. Based on this information, agencies <span class="priority">will</span> be provided a summary scorecard that provides agency-specific performance metric data and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>
<p>Strategic plans [for the Data Center Optimization Initiative] shall also be made available in a machine-readable JSON  format at [agency].gov/digitalstrategy/datacenteroptimizationstrategicplan.json.</p>
<p>Strengthen data management and release practices- To ensure that agency data assets are managed and maintained throughout their life cycle, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> adopt effective data asset p01tfolio management approaches. Within six (6) months of the date of this Memorandum, agencies and interagency groups <span class="priority">must</span> review and, where appropriate, revise existing policies and procedures to strengthen their data management and release practices to ensure consistency with the requirements in this Memorandum, and take the following actions:</p>
<p>Strengthen measures to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully protected and that data are properly secured- Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> incorporate privacy analyses into each stage of the information 's life cycle. In particular, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> review the information collected or created for valid restrictions to release to determine whether it can be made publicly available, consistent with the Open Government Directive's presumption in favor of openness, and to the extent permitted by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality pledge, security, trade secret, contractual, or other valid restrictions to release. If the agency determines that information should not be made publicly available on one of these grounds, the agency <span class="priority">must</span> document this determination in consultation with its Office of General Counsel or equivalent. As agencies consider whether or not information may be disclosed, they <span class="priority">must</span> also account for the "mosaic effect" of data aggregation. Agencies should note that the mosaic effect demands a risk-based analysis, often utilizing statistical methods whose parameters can change over time, depending on the nature of the information, the availability of other information, and the technology in place that could facilitate the process of identification. Because of the cop1plexity of this analysis and the scope of data involved, agencies may choose to take advantage of entities in the Executive Branch that may have relevant expe1tise, including the staff of Data.gov. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each agency to perform the necessary analysis and comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies. In some cases, this assessment may affect the amount, type, form, and detail of data released by agencies.</p>
<p>Strengthening IT Portfolio Management is a continued focus and commitment to assess the effectiveness of current IT management practices and to address opportunities to improve management of IT resources. Authoritative data is key to providing the ability of IT and business leaders to have data-driven discussions about cost and value of IT to best support business goals. As a Government, we <span class="priority">will</span> be exploring the adoption of standardized methodologies for IT costing, geared effectively and consistently (using a data-driven agreed upon framework), communicating the cost of IT, and also attributing that cost to business services.</p>
<p>Submissions <span class="priority">should</span> be consistent with OMB Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Guidance. The IT Portfolio Summary <span class="priority">is required</span> to be submitted to OMB the same day in September, or within one week, of your Agency�s current services baseline budget submission. Timing details on the Major Business Cases are outlined in the FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance.</p>
<p>Subsequent to initial project reviews and approval of revised plans, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> review project status, and as necessary <span class="priority">will</span> re-engage the Board, on a quarterly basis through FY 2012. These reviews <span class="priority">will</span> be used, among other things, to inform the appropriations process for FY 2011 and OMB�s review of budget proposals for FY 2012. Funding for projects subject to the apportionment process under this guidance <span class="priority">will</span> continue to be apportioned on a quarterly basis through Category B allocations. Projects must continue to meet 90 to 120-day milestones in order for OMB to release project funding for additional segments. For projects that have a proven track record of achieving specific milestones within well-defined segments, OMB may employ flexibility regarding funds control.</p>
<p>Substantial compliance is achieved when an agency�s financial management systems routinely provide reliable and timely financial information for managing day-to-day operations as well as to produce reliable financial statements, maintain effective internal control, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. FFMIA substantial compliance <span class="priority">will</span> be determined annually at the department-wide or agency-wide level for the 24 major CFO Act agencies. Agencies <span class="priority">can</span> determine whether the requirements are being met by applying the FFMIA risk model, which ranks risks from nominal to significant (See Figure 1). The risk indicators in the model assist agencies in determining whether reliable and consistent information is available for decision making. The higher the risk, the more likely the agency is non-compliant. [Footnote] The 24 CFO Act agencies are defined in Appendix A of the OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended. [see page 7 for diagram]</p>
<p>Summary of Performance and Financial Information. Non-CFO Act agencies that produce an Annual Performance Report (APR) and AFR and all CFO Act Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> submit a Summary of Performance and Financial Information to OMB by February 15th of the fiscal year following the fiscal year that is being reported. If February 15th falls on the weekend or holiday, the due date will automatically move to the next business day.</p>
<p>The Administration is committed to ensuring that, to the greatest extent and with the fewest constraints possible and consistent with law and the objectives set out below, the direct results of federally funded scientific research are made available to and useful for the public, industry, and the scientific community. Such results <span class="definition">include</span> peer-reviewed publications and digital data.</p>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <span class="priority">shall</span>:<br />�� as needed, promulgate requirements, regulations, and best practices for acquiring, using, and, where applicable, disposing of the commodities managed through strategic sourcing initiatives.</p>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <span class="priority">shall</span>:<br />�� implement, in consultation with the SSLC, at least five new government-wide strategic sourcing solutions in each of FY 2013 and FY 2014;</p>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <span class="priority">shall</span>:<br />�� increase the transparency of prices paid for common goods and services for use by agency officials in market research and negotiations; and</p>
<p>The CIO Council <span class="priority">shall</span> publish and disseminate information from the FedRAMP PMO and JAB to Executive departments and agencies.</p>
<p>The CIO <span class="priority">shall</span> pool their agency's purchasing power across their entire organization to drive down costs and improve service for commodity IT.</p>
<p>The CSP�s issuance and maintenance policy influences its e-authentication process trustworthiness. The E-Authentication Initiative <span class="priority">will</span> therefore develop an assessment process for the government to determine the maximum assurance level merited by the CSP.</p>
<p>The DATA Act <span class="priority">requires</span> all agencies to use these data definition standards [ref. Req. 79.13] for the collection and reporting of agency-level and award-level data by two years after their issuance. Implementation efforts <span class="priority">shall</span> include agency efforts to modify existing agency regulatory and non-regulatory policies (if required), business processes, and, as needed, systems to support agency-level financial reporting and new data quality requirements under this Memorandum. Agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> modify policies, internal business processes, and/or information technology, as needed, to ensure consistent publication of agency-level and award level reporting under the DATA Act and FF AT A on USAspending.gov (or its successor site).</p>
<p>The DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative], as described in this memorandum, requires agencies to develop and report on data center strategies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community, and portions of other agencies that operate systems related to national security are subject to only certain portions ofFITARA, as provided for in the statute, and <span class="priority">shall</span> meet with OMB no later than 60 days following the final release of this guidance to clarify the applicability of this guidance throughout their organizations and activities, including alternative requirements or exceptions.</p>
<p>The Deputy Director for Management <span class="priority">is required</span> by the Act to chair the Federal CIO Council. The Administrator for E-Government and IT <span class="priority">is required</span> to work with the Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in areas of shared responsibility. Other offices in OMB <span class="priority">will</span> be involved in providing guidance and oversight of specific sections of the Act. For example, the head of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy <span class="priority">will</span> lead OMB�s work on Section 210 regarding the use of share-in-savings contracts for Federal procurements. OMB Resource Management Offices <span class="priority">will</span> work with the Office of E-Government and IT as they oversee budgetary activities related to E-Government and IT.</p>
<p>The E-Gov Act also requires the Director to issue guidance on several sections of the Act, including:<br />� Electronic signatures, so that citizens can interact electronically with the Government in a secure manner (Section 203(b))<br />� Categorizing and Indexing standards for government information (Section 207(d))<br />� Standards for agency websites (Section 207(f))<br />� Agency reporting and dissemination of federally funded R&D (Section 207(g))<br />� Privacy issues, including privacy impact assessments, privacy notices on government websites, and privacy policies in machine readable formats (section 208(b)).</p>
<p>The E-Government Act enhances OMB�s authorities under the Clinger-Cohen Act4 with greater emphasis in the development of electronic initiatives across the government. For example, under the E-Government Act, OMB <span class="priority">is responsible</span> for overseeing government wide initiatives, including:<br />� An integrated Internet portal (see Section 204(a)), which is already being accomplished through the Firstgov.gov portal<br />� Creation by the National Science Foundation of a database and website to track Federally funded R&D (see Section 207(g))<br />� Share-in-savings contracts for IT procurements (up to 5 agencies may participate per year) (see Section 210(c)), to permit agencies to retain a portion of the savings derived from share-in-savings contracts<br />� Designating up to five pilot projects to integrate databases and data elements for public databases (see Section 212(d))<br />� Agency use of common geographic information practices (Section 216(d)).</p>
<p>The E.O. Implementing Instructions also advise that "[a]ll existing and new data centers <span class="priority">shall</span> have at least one certified Data Center Energy Practitioner (DCEP) assigned to manage its performance."</p>
<p>The Federal CFO and CIO Councils <span class="priority">will</span> create a set of guidelines for increasing transparency in the utilization of IT funds. Agencies <span class="priority">will</span> follow these guidelines and institute additional review processes for multi-year funds and portfolio funding to prevent mismanagement of increased funding flexibility (e.g., masking program delays or overruns).</p>
<p>The Federal CIO Council, OMB, and OPM <span class="priority">will</span> work to design opportunities for industry rotation to allow Federal program managers to remain up-to-date with the latest skills while managing conflict of interest issues.</p>
<p>The Federal CIO Council, OMB, and OPM, over the next 12 � 18 months, <span class="priority">will be</span> responsible for developing a process that will support and encourage movement of program managers across government and industry.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">needs to</span> define processes and rules for sharing its incident reporting with the private sector. Formulation of these rules <span class="priority">should</span> consider classification and privacy issues. In addition, the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> help the research community gain access, with appropriate controls, to cybersecurity - related event data that could be used to develop tools, test theories, and develop workable solutions. Such sharing <span class="other">would</span> need to address the protection of sensitive or proprietary data and personal identity information.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> undertake a comprehensive review of policies (such as security classification and clearance requirements) that inhibit interagency sharing of cybersecurity information, seek improvements in information sharing, and <span class="priority">ensure</span> that they preserve civil liberties and privacy rights and appropriate protection for sensitive information. This review <span class="priority">should</span> take into account the progress that the Federal government has made through the Security and Suitability Reform Initiative and the Information Sharing Environment effort in examining all facets of the security and suitability processing components.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> work with State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector�including data owners, network operators, and experts on privacy and civil liberties�to develop options for cybersecurity-related information sharing that address concerns with privacy and proprietary information and make information sharing mutually beneficial in the national interest. Private companies <span class="other">are</span> concerned about the potential uses of their information. The government <span class="priority">must</span> protect privacy rights, law enforcement equities, intelligence sources and methods, and government information that would provide unfair competitive advantages. Clarity and accountability for both government and the private sector <span class="other">are</span> needed to address these concerns. Possible options include:<br />� Creation of a not-for-profit non-governmental organization to serve as a trusted third-party host where government and private sector information may be shared to enhance the security of critical government and private-sector networks. Such an organization could leverage commercial services without disrupting the growing security service market.<br />� Continued engagement between the Federal government (e.g., law enforcement agencies) and individual firms or groups of firms�possibly with the participation of State, local, and tribal governments�that could achieve a level of voluntary information sharing within a particular sector or region beyond what could be achieved in a broader setting.</p>
<p>The IT Reform plan restructured the investment review boards (lRBs) by requiring Agency CIOs to lead "TechStat" sessions - actionable meetings designed to improve line-of-sight between project teams and senior executives. Outcomes from these sessions <span class="priority">must</span> be formalized and followed-up through completion, with the goal of terminating or turning around onethird of all underperforming IT Investments.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <span class="priority">will</span> facilitate and lead the development of standards for security, interoperability, and portability.</p>
<p>The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) <span class="priority">will</span> provide guidance to agencies on the Paperwork Reduction Act and a "Fast Track" review process for efforts to gather customer feedback to improve service delivery. OIRA <span class="priority">will</span> post online introductory documents for program managers on different options for collecting customer feedback.</p>
<p>The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) hereby <span class="priority">directs</span> each Federal agency with over $100 million in annual conduct of research and development expenditures to develop a plan to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the Federal Government. This includes any results published in peer-reviewed scholarly publications that are based on research that directly arises from Federal funds, as defined in relevant OMB circulars (e.g., A-21 and A-11). It is preferred that agencies work together, where appropriate, to develop these plans.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, in coordination with the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], <span class="priority">should</span> consider how to better attract cybersecurity expertise and to increase retention of employees with such expertise within the federal service.  Departments and agencies have had success attracting new employees from industry, but the time required to obtain, transfer, or renew security clearances leads to lost opportunities. Federal employees <span class="priority">need to</span> be able to build portfolios and advance careers in ways they might not be able to do within a single agency. Shared training and rotational assignments across agencies and potentially with the private sector would not only be efficient, but would promote beneficial cross-fertilization and the building of professional networks.</p>
<p>The SSLC <span class="priority">will</span> meet regularly to provide long-term leadership of the government's strategic sourcing efforts as well as to take actions that save taxpayer dollars now.</p>
<p>The Senior Agency Officials for Privacy are <span class="priority">required</span> to report on an annual basis and must submit the following documents through CyberScope as part of the annual data submission:<br />� A memorandum describing the agency�s privacy program, including: <br />o A description of the structure of the agency�s privacy program, including the role of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy and the resources that the agency has dedicated to privacy-related functions;   <br />o An assessment of whether the Senior Agency Official for Privacy has the necessary authority, independence, access to agency leadership, subject matter expertise, and resources to effectively manage and oversee all privacy-related functions across the agency; and <br />o Any other information OMB should know about how privacy-related functions are performed at the agency.</p>

<p>To ensure the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <span class="priority">requires</span> agencies to: 1. Continue to <span class="other">Assign</span> a Unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) for Financial Assistance Awards. All Federal agencies <span class="priority">must</span> continue to <span class="other">assign</span> a unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) to each financial assistance award. Once an agency assigns a FAIN and reports it to USAspending.gov, the Federal agency may not, except in limited circumstances, modify the FAIN during the life of the award. Further, once a Federal agency assigns a FAIN, that Federal agency <span class="priority">must</span> ensure that the FAIN is clearly identified in all Federal award documents. As a term and condition of the award, Federal agencies <span class="priority"><span class="priority">must</span> require</span> that all recipients report subaward information by FAIN into the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). Federal procurement awards continue to be subject to the requirements for uniform procurement instrument identification numbers in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 4.16.</p>
<p>To facilitate the exchange of best practices and the development of agency customer service plans and signature initiatives, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> coordinate a Customer Service Task Force ("Task Force"), comprised of agencies that provide significant services, that <span class="priority">will</span> meet regularly until agencies publish their plans.</p>
<p>To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act for additional reporting, development, and implementation of financial data standards on USAspending. gov (or its successor site), this<br />Memorandum <span class="priority">requires</span> agency compliance with the following policies: 1. Make Agency-Level Financial Data Available for Publication. Pursuant to Section 3 of the DATA Act, by <span class="priority">May</span> 9, 2017, Treasury, in consultation with OMB, <span class="priority">must</span> publish a report of funds made available to, or expended by, a Federal agency or component of a Federal Agency on USAspending.gov (or its successor site). Reports <span class="priority">should</span> be published monthly, when practicable, but not less than quarterly. OMB and Treasury <span class="priority">will</span> fulfill a portion of this requirement by leveraging existing agency reporting. Concurrent with this activity: � Agencies <span class="priority">will</span> continue to submit agency-level financial data to OMB and Treasury using the Treasury Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol (GTAS) system. � OMB <span class="priority">will</span> continue to produce bulk, downloadable, machine-readable (e.g., XML) versions of the OMB SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, and post these and other outputs on its website and the White House website. The tags and other technical characteristics in OMB's XML versions of the SF 133 reports <span class="priority">may</span> change as a result of work on data definitions or for other reasons. � OMB and Treasury <span class="priority">will</span> make these bulk, downloadable, machine-readable versions of the SF 133 report accessible from USAspending.gov (or its successor site).</p>
<p>To implement this requirement [to ensure availability of agency-level and award-level financial data sourced from<br />agency financial systems and implement linkage between agency financial fystem(s) and management systems using award IDs, ref. Req. 79.18] agencies <span class="priority">will be required</span> to carry the prime award ID in agency financial systems, in order to link between an accounting transaction and an award. The award identification (FAIN for financial assistance and Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) for procurement) serves as the key to associate data across award systems and financial systems.</p>
<p>To increase accountability, promote informed participation by the public, and create economic opportunity, each agency <span class="priority">shall</span> take prompt steps to expand access to information by making it available online in open formats.   With respect to information, the presumption <span class="priority">shall</span> be in favor of openness (to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions).</p>
<p>To request such approval [ref. Req. 21.05], agencies <span class="priority">must</span> submit a written justification that includes an analysis of alternatives (including opportunities for cloud services, inter-agency shared services, and third party co-location) and an explanation of the net reduction in the agency�s data center inventory that will be facilitated by the new or expanded data center (such as through consolidation of multiple existing data centers into a single new data center).</p>
<p>To successfully implement a government service electronically (or e-government), Federal agencies <span class="priority">must</span> determine the required level of assurance in the authentication for each transaction. This is accomplished through a risk assessment for each transaction. The assessment identifies: risks, and their likelihood of occurrence.</p>
<p>To support PM mobility, the Federal CIO Council <span class="priority">will</span> build a repository of information on all Federal Government IT PMs, including relevant background, specific expertise, implementation experience, and performance as part of its best practices collaboration platform.</p>
<p>To support agencies in the execution of prizes that further the policy objectives of the Federal Government, the Administration <span class="priority">will</span> make available a web-based platform for prizes and challenges within 120 days. This platform <span class="priority">will</span> provide a forum for agencies to post problems and invite communities of problem solvers to suggest, collaborate on, and deliver solutions.</p>
<p>To support the shared services efforts described by this memorandum, the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) <span class="priority">shall</span> serve as the managing partner of the Federal Government�s data center line of business  and data center shared services.</p>
<p>To that end, by March 2013, the SSLC <span class="priority">shall</span> submit to OMB a set of recommendations for management strategies for specific goods and services � including several IT commodities identified through the PortfolioStat process - that would ensure that the Federal government receives the most favorable offer possible.</p>
<p>To the extent permissible under the FAR, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> include automated infrastructure management requirements for all new data center service contracts or procurement vehicles. Further, any new data center contractor procurement vehicle <span class="priority">must</span> require the contractor to report to the contracting agency whether the contracted facility utilizes automated infrastructure management, except where such data is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies <span class="priority">are encouraged</span> to require the same for extension of existing vehicles.</p>
<p>To the extent permissible under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), agencies <span class="priority">must</span> include PUE [power usage effectiveness] requirements for all new data center contracts or procurement vehicles.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent practicable, all strategic sourcing opportunities <span class="priority">shall</span> seek to increase participation by small businesses.</p>
<p>Treasury is piloting the data exchange concept [ref. Req. 79.15] with select agencies and <span class="priority">will</span> issue further guidance and tools, such as open source code and a technical implementation guide, once the pilots are complete. Treasury <span class="priority">will</span> provide technical assistance to agencies as they adopt the standard exchange format and taxonomy.</p>
<p>Under various national security and homeland security Presidential directives, and pursuant to its statutory authorities, DHS oversees critical infrastructure protection, operates the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), oversees implementation of the Trusted Internet Connection initiative, and takes other actions to help secure both the Federal civilian government systems and the private sector. At the same time, OMB has a number of<br />cybersecurity responsibilities, principally in connection with FISMA. The Cybersecurity Coordinator leads the interagency process for cybersecurity strategy and policy development. To clarify and avoid confusion, effective immediately, OMB will be responsible for the submission of the annual FISMA report to Congress, for the development and approval of the cybersecurity portions of the President�s Budget, for the traditional OMB budgetary and fiscal oversight of the agencies� use of funds, and for coordination with the Cybersecurity Coordinator on all policy issues related to the prior three responsibilities. The Cybersecurity Coordinator will have visibility into DHS efforts to ensure Federal agency compliance with FISMA and will serve as the principal White House official to coordinate interagency cooperation with DHS cybersecurity efforts. Effective immediately, DHS will exercise primary responsibility within the executive branch for the operational aspects of Federal agency cybersecurity with respect to the Federal information systems that fall within FISMA under 44 U.S.C. �3543. In carrying out this responsibility and the accompanying activities, DHS <span class="priority">shall</span> be subject to general OMB oversight in accordance with July 6, 2010 Section 3543(a), and DHS <span class="priority">shall</span> be subject to the limitations and requirements that apply to OMB under Section 3543(b)-(c). DHS activities will include (but will not be limited to): <br />� overseeing the government-wide and agency-specific implementation of and reporting on cybersecurity policies and guidance; <br />� overseeing and assisting government-wide and agency-specific efforts to provide adequate, risk-based and cost-effective cybersecurity; <br />� overseeing the agencies� compliance with FISMA and developing analyses for OMB to assist in the development of the FISMA annual report; <br />� overseeing the agencies� cybersecurity operations and incident response and providing appropriate assistance; and <br />� annually reviewing the agencies� cybersecurity programs. <br /><br />All departments and agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> coordinate and cooperate with DHS as it carries out its cybersecurity responsibility and activities as noted here.</p>
<p>Use common core and extensible metadata- Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> describe information using<br />common core metadata, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data, as it is collected and created. Metadata should also include information about origin, linked data, geographic location, time series continuations, data quality, and other relevant indices that reveal relationships between datasets and allow the public to determine the fitness of the data source. Agencies may expand upon the basic common metadata based on standards, specifications, or formats developed within different communities (e.g., financial, health, geospatial, law enforcement). Groups that develop and promulgate these metadata<br />specifications <span class="priority">must</span> review them for compliance with the common core metadata standard, specifications, and formats.</p>
<p>Use data standards- Consistent with existing policies relating to Federal agencies' use of standards2 for information as it is collected or created, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> use standards in order to promote data interoperability and openness.</p>
<p>Use machine-readable and open formats 19 - Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> use machine-readable and open formats for information as it is collected or created. While information should be collected electronically by default, machine-readable and open formats <span class="priority">must</span> be used in conjunction with both electronic and telephone or paper-based information collection effot1s. Additionally, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data and to the extent permitted by law, agencies should prioritize the use of open formats that are nonproprietary, publicly available, and that place no restrictions upon their use.</p>
<p>Web services that serve primarily non-browser clients, such as web APis, <span class="priority">may require</span> a more gradual and hands-on migration strategy, as not all clients can be expected to be configured for HTTPS connections or to successfully follow redirects.</p>
<p>Websites and services available over HTTPS <span class="priority">must</span> enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to instruct compliant browsers to assume HTTPS going forward.</p>
<p>Websites served over HTTPS <span class="priority">need to</span> ensure that all external resources (images, scripts, fonts, iframes, etc.) are also loaded over a secure connection. Modern browsers will refuse to load many insecure resources referenced from within a secure website. When migrating existing websites, this can involve a combination of automated and manual effort to update, replace, or remove references to insecure resources. For some websites, this can be the most time consuming aspect ofthe migration process.</p>
<p>What <span class="priority">must</span> agencies do and by when ; 11/15/05 ;  <br />� Assign an official to lead and coordinate agency planning, <br />� Complete an inventory of existing routers, switches, and hardware firewalls (see Attachment A for details);Begin an inventory of all other existing IP compliant devices and technologies not captured in the first inventory (see Attachment A for details); and <br />� Begin impact analysis to determine fiscal and operational impacts and risks of migrating to IPv6 (see Attachment B for details).</p>
<p>What <span class="priority">must</span> agencies do and by when ; February 2006 ; <br />� Using the guidance issued by Chief Information Officers Council Architecture and Infrastructure Committee (see below), address each of the elements in Attachment C in your agency�s IPv6 transition plan and provide the completed IPv6 transition plan as part of the agency�s Enterprise Architecture (EA) submission to OMB. Additional guidance on your agency�s EA submission will be forthcoming. <br />� Provide a progress report on the inventory and impact analysis, as part of the agency�s Enterprise Architecture (EA) submission to OMB. Additional guidance on your agency�s EA submission will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>What <span class="priority">must</span> agencies do and by when ; June 30, 2006 ; <br />� Complete inventory of existing IP compliant devices and technologies not captured in first inventory, and <br />� Complete impact analysis of fiscal and operational impacts and risks.</p>
<p>What <span class="priority">must</span> agencies do and by when ; June 30, 2008 ; <br />All agency infrastructures (network backbones) <span class="priority">must</span> be using IPv6 and agency networks <span class="priority">must</span> interface with this infrastructure. Agencies will include progress reports on meeting this target date as part of their EA transition strategy.</p>
<p>When GSA is ready to begin this phase [ref. Req. 44.08], it <span class="priority">will</span> notify agencies to update their list of past purchases and future projections, and <span class="priority">will</span> follow the same sequence of events listed above for these categories.</p>
<p>When developing authentication processes, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> satisfy the requirements for managing security in the collection and storage of information associated with validating user identities. The E-Government Act of 2002, section 208 requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments for electronic information systems and collections. This includes performing an assessment when authentication technology is added to an electronic<br />information system accessed by members of the public. For additional information on privacy impact assessments, consult OMB guidance.</p>
<p>When evaluating options for new IT deployments, OMB <span class="priority">will require</span> that agencies default to cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable, cost-effective cloud option exists. To facilitate this shift, we will be standing up secure government-wide cloud computing platforms.</p>
<p>When upgrading to the next major release of its current core financial system or modernizing to a different core financial system, an agency <span class="priority">must</span> use an external provider which is either a Federal shared service provider that has been designated by OMB or a commercial vendor. The implemented system <span class="priority">must</span> also be maintained by the external provider. If agencies cannot migrate to an external provider immediately, then they <span class="priority">should</span> take incremental steps by moving their hosting or application management support to a provider.</p>
<p>While agencies <span class="priority">must</span> submit their data to OMB by November 13, 2015 (in reference to Requirement 78.01), their Agency reports are due to Congress by March 1, 2016.</p>
<p>While every agency <span class="priority">must</span> eliminate inefficiencies from its acquisition processes, this initiative puts additional responsibilities for designing and implementing government-wide strategic sourcing solutions on large agencies, which make up the vast majority of all Federal contracting.</p>
<p>With increased focus on data sharing, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> pay close attention to handling responsibly their own data and the data they share with or receive from other agencies. When information about individuals is involved, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> pay especially close attention to privacy interests and <span class="priority">must</span> incorporate measures to safeguard those interests. Prior to any data sharing, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> review and meet the Privacy Act requirements for computer matching, including developing a computer matching agreement and publishing notice of the proposed match in the�Federal Register; OMB Guidance on Computer Matching (54�Fed. Reg.�25818, June 19, 1989); and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I, "Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals." Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> also review and meet applicable requirements under other laws, including the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</p>
<p>With respect to Federal statistical agencies and units as defined in the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA), covered agencies under FITARA <span class="priority">shall</span> implement this guidance in a manner that ensures that statistical data collected under a pledge of confidentiality solely for statistical purposes are used exclusively for statistical purposes, consistent with CIPSEA.</p>
<p>Within 12 months, GSA <span class="priority">will</span> utilize [the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) E-mail Working Group] requirements to stand up government-wide contract vehicles for cloud-based email solutions. GSA <span class="priority">will</span> also begin a similar process specifically designed for other back-end, cloud-based solutions.</p>

<p>Within 45 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB, the Federal Chief Information Officer, and the Federal Chief Technology Officer <span class="priority">will</span> establish a working group that focuses on transparency, accountability, participation, and collaboration within the Federal Government. This group, with senior level representation from program and management offices throughout the Government, <span class="priority">will</span> serve several critical functions, including: <br />i. Providing a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote transparency, including system and process solutions for information collection, aggregation, validation, and dissemination; <br />ii. Coordinating efforts to implement existing mandates for Federal spending transparency, including the Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act and the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act; and <br />iii. Providing a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote participation and collaboration, including how to experiment with new technologies, take advantage of the expertise and insight of people both inside and outside the Federal Government, and form high-impact collaborations with researchers, the private sector, and civil society.</p>
<p>Within 60 days of the issuance of this policy, the FedRAMP PMO <span class="priority">shall</span> publish a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for FedRAMP providing the initial process for Executive departments and agencies and CSPs to adhere to the FedRAMP security authorization requirements created by the JAB. The CONOPS <span class="priority">shall</span> be updated, as required, by the FedRAMP PMO and made available to Executive departments and agencies and CSPs</p>
<p>Within 60 days of this order, agencies <span class="priority">will</span> provide revised project plans for all projects covered herein to OMB for review. Such plans, as described in Attachment A, shall clearly outline the project�s strategy for reducing costs, shortening the project timeline, and reducing risks. Criteria for review <span class="priority">will</span> be the Guiding Principles described earlier in this Memorandum.</p>
<p>Within 60 days, GSA <span class="priority">will</span> provide agency-specific lists on MAX and the Federal CIO <span class="priority">will</span> issue instructions for how agencies should identify opportunities to improve content as well as eliminate duplicative and outdated websites.</p>

<p>Within six months, Agency CIOs and CFOs <span class="priority">will</span> identify programs at several agencies for which added budget flexibility could save money and improve outcomes. OMB and agencies <span class="priority">will</span> work with Congress to develop proposed budget models to complement the modular development approach. In addition, OMB and agencies <span class="priority">will</span> evaluate mechanisms for increased transparency for these programs.</p>
<p>Within six months, OFPP, with input from agencies, <span class="priority">will</span> develop guidance on requirements for IT acquisition specialists. In addition, OFPP <span class="priority">will</span> develop guidance on curriculum standards to cross-train program managers and IT acquisition professionals.</p>
<p>Within six months, the Federal CIO Council <span class="priority">will</span> develop a collaboration portal to exchange best practices, case studies, and allow for real-time problem solving.</p>
<p>Within the next 12 months, the Federal CIO <span class="priority">will</span> develop a strategy for shared services. That strategy <span class="priority">will</span> build on earlier Federal Government successes in shared services and include benchmarks on current usage and uptake rates, as well as service level agreements (SLAs), customer satisfaction levels, costs, and overall economic effectiveness.</p>
<p>Within the next 18 months, OMB and GSA <span class="priority">will</span> create a government-wide marketplace that better utilizes<br />spare capacity within operational data centers.</p>
<p>Within the next 18 months, OMB and GSA <span class="priority">will</span> create a government-wide marketplace that better utilizes spare capacity within operational data centers. The online marketplace <span class="priority">will</span> match agencies with extra capacity to agencies with increasing demand, thereby improving the utilization of existing facilities.</p>
<p>Within the next six months, OMB <span class="priority">will</span> work with Congress to develop a workable funding model for �commodity� IT services. These funding models <span class="priority">will</span> be applicable to both inter-agency IT services and intra-agency IT services.</p>
<p>Within the next six months, after completing security certification, GSA <span class="priority">will</span> make a common set of contract vehicles for cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions available government-wide.</p>
<p>Within the next six months, each agency <span class="priority">will</span> designate a senior, dedicated data center consolidation program manager with project management experience and technical competence in IT infrastructure. Because data center consolidation requires interactions with many stakeholder groups, the data center program manager <span class="priority">must</span> also have strong communication skills. The data center program manager at each agency <span class="priority">will</span> be responsible for developing a plan with interim, verifiable milestones to reach the agency�s data center reduction target and monitor progress toward those goals.</p>
<p>Within the next six months, the Federal CIO <span class="priority">will</span> publish a strategy to accelerate the safe and secure adoption of cloud computing across the government.</p>
<p>Within the next three months, the Federal CIO Council <span class="priority">will</span> launch a government-wide Data Center Consolidation Task Force comprised of the data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force <span class="priority">will</span> be responsible for working together to share progress toward individual agency goals and the overall Federal target of a minimum of 800 data center closures by 2015. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force <span class="priority">will</span> meet monthly to review progress of each consolidation project and ensure government-wide alignment between agency efforts where appropriate. The Task Force <span class="priority">will</span> serve as a �community of practice� for Agency CIOs and data center program managers to share best practices from this effort and enhance consolidation effectiveness.</p>
<p>Working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the next-generation infrastructure. The United States <span class="priority">should</span> harness the full benefits of technology to address national economic needs and national security requirements. Federal policy <span class="priority">should</span> address requirements for national security, protection of intellectual property, and the availability and continuity of infrastructure, even when it is under attack by sophisticated adversaries. The Federal government through partnerships with the private sector and academia needs to articulate coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives. The government, working with State and local partners, <span class="priority">should</span> identify procurement strategies that will incentivize the market to make more secure products and services available to the public. Additional incentive mechanisms that the government <span class="priority">should</span> explore include adjustments to liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.</p>
<p>[...] agencies <span class="priority">will</span> identify specific IT program management competency gaps in the next Human Capital Management Report and develop specific plans to close the IT PM gap. To ensure that agencies are executing these plans, senior agency executives <span class="priority">will</span> review their progress and provide an interim report to OMB, 12 months after the next Human Capital Management Report is published.</p>
<p>[...] any new data center contract or procurement vehicle <span class="priority">must require</span> the contractor to report the quarterly average PUE [power usage effectiveness] of the contracted facility to the contracting agency, except where that data center�s PUE is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies <span class="priority">are encourage</span>d to require the same for extension of existing vehicles. [Footnote:] This can be PUE for the facility as a whole in cases where the agency only contracts for a portion of a larger facility; however, if PUE metrics are available specific to the agency�s use, that is preferred.</p>
<p>[...] each IT investment <span class="priority">should</span> demonstrate the enabling and improvement of mission and program performance. Agencies demonstrate the IT Investment requirements and governance processes through Agency Major IT Business Cases, supporting documentation, Information Resources Management Strategic Plan, Enterprise Roadmap, and Agency IT Portfolio Summary submissions. The agency <span class="priority">must</span> further demonstrate how the investment supports a business line or enterprise service performance goal as documented in the agency�s enterprise architecture (EA), and annual Enterprise Roadmap submission to OMB. Documents used to manage the planning, development, implementation, and operation of IT investments and documents that demonstrate the outcomes of agency, branch, and bureau governance decisions <span class="priority">should</span> be maintained and made readily available if requested by OMB.</p>
<p>[...] he agency CIO <span class="priority">will</span> serve as the primary official for assisting agency heads in implementing the Act and this guidance in the agency. Agency CIOs are already expected to lead work under their agency�s investment review board (IRB) to identify investments that further the agency�s mission and programs in delivering services and information to citizens. In addition, agency CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> work with the IRB to identify and pursue investments that could be shared across the agency or with other agencies to address similar missions and constituencies. Agency CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> continue to ensure that e-government investments are reviewed as part of the agency�s budget and capital investment process (i.e., developing a capital asset plan and business case) and that these processes are aligned with the agency�s Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA).</p>
<p>[...] the cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, <span class="priority">will need to</span> ensure effective implementation of cybersecurity-related policy and activities.</p>
<p>[1) Oversight of Financial Management Systems:] Agencies <span class="priority">are responsible</span> for managing their financial management systems even when they utilize a service provider to implement, operate and maintain the systems. Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> also ensure that their financial management systems meet applicable Federal requirements and are adequately supported throughout the systems� life cycle. All agreement and contracts with service providers <span class="priority">must</span> clearly outline the goals necessary to achieve sound financial management. Furthermore, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> monitor the service providers� performance and ensure that service failures are resolved promptly.</p>
<p>[2) Develop and Maintain Agency-wide Financial Management System Plans:] Agencies <span class="priority">must</span> prepare a plan for their financial management systems, which incorporates their strategic plan, financial management plan, enterprise architecture, and budget request. Once a plan is established, it <span class="priority">must</span> be updated at least annually or earlier when a significant event occurs (e.g., reorganization).<br /><br />In establishing a plan, an agency <span class="priority">must</span> consider its own financial management systems� life cycle. Specifically, it <span class="priority">must</span> project a reasonable useful life of the investment and plan the next system upgrade accordingly. Technology trends and product support schedules <span class="priority">should be</span> considered when projecting the useful life. The plan <span class="priority">must</span> also identify existing problems related to the current system.<br /><br />Each financial management system plan <span class="priority">must</span>:<br />a. describe the existing financial management system architecture and any changes needed to implement a targeted architecture;<br />b. be consistent with the enterprise architecture, information resource management plan, and IT capital plan;<br />c. provide a strategy for maintaining adequacy, consistency, and timeliness of financial information;<br />d. identify projects necessary to achieve FFMIA substantial compliance within three years from the date of noncompliance;<br />e. contain milestones for correcting any material weaknesses;<br />f. identify and make proposals to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary systems;<br />g. include a strategy to migrate to an external provider;<br />h. contain milestones for equipment acquisitions and other actions necessary to implement the plan;<br />i. identify financial management personnel needs and actions to ensure those needs are met; and<br />j. estimate the costs of implementing the plan.</p>
<p>[3) Develop and Maintain an Agency-wide Inventory of Financial Management Systems] Agencies <span class="priority">are required</span> to maintain an inventory of their existing and proposed financial management systems. Annually, agencies <span class="priority">will</span> provide FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] with an annual inventory of their financial management systems.</p>
<p>[4) Develop and Maintain Agency Financial Management System Directives] Agencies <span class="priority">shall</span> issue, update, and maintain agency-wide financial management system directives to reflect policies defined in this Circular.</p>
<p>[Agencies DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative] Strategic Plans <span class="priority">must</span> include, at a minimum, the following:]<br />2. Planned and achieved closures, by year;</p>
<p>[Agencies DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative] Strategic Plans <span class="priority">must</span> include, at a minimum, the following:]<br />3. An explanation for any optimization metrics and closures for which the agency did not meet the planned level in a previous Strategic Plan;</p>
<p>[Agencies DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative] Strategic Plans <span class="priority">must</span> include, at a minimum, the following:]<br />4. Year-by-year calculations of target and actual agency-wide spending and cost savings on data centers from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, including:<br />a. A description of any initial costs for data center consolidation and optimization; and<br />b. Life cycle cost savings and other improvements (including those beyond fiscal year 2018, if applicable);</p>
<p>[Agencies DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative] Strategic Plans <span class="priority">must</span> include, at a minimum, the following:]<br />5. Historical costs, cost savings, and cost avoidances due to data center consolidation and optimization through fiscal year 2015;</p>
<p>[Agencies DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative] Strategic Plans <span class="priority">must</span> include, at a minimum, the following:]<br />6. A statement from the agency CIO stating whether the agency has complied with all reporting requirements in this memorandum and the data center requirements of FITARA. If the agency has not complied with all reporting requirements, the agency <span class="priority">must</span> provide a statement describing the reasons for not complying.</p>
<p>[As a part of  the capital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <span class="priority">will</span> be used to meet FITARA requirements:] Automatic TechStats. Moreover, if an investment has a high risk rating (red CIO evaluation in the ITDB) for three consecutive months beginning July 1, 2015, agencies <span class="priority">must</span> hold a TechStat session on that investment. The session <span class="priority">must</span> be held within 30 days of the completion of the third month. If this investment remains categorized with a red CIO evaluation one year following the Tech Stat session then OMB <span class="priority">may</span> take appropriate performance and/or budgetary actions until the agency has addressed the root cause and ensured the investment's ability to complete the remaining activities within planned cost and schedule.</p>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <span class="priority">will</span> be used to meet FITARA requirements:] Data improvement program. If OMB or the agency CIO <span class="other">determines</span> data reported to the ITDB is not timely and reliable, the CIO (in consultation with the agency head) <span class="priority">must</span> notify OMB through the IDC and establish within 30 days of this determination an improvement program to address the deficiencies. The CIO <span class="priority">will</span> collaborate with OMB to develop a plan that includes root cause analysis, timeline to resolve, and lessons learned. In addition, the CIO <span class="priority">will</span> communicate to OMB the steps the agency is taking to execute the data improvement program and the progress the agency is making. Agencies <span class="priority">will</span> provide updates on the status of this program on a quarterly basis as a part of their IDC submission until the identified deficiency is resolved.</p>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <span class="priority">will</span> be used to meet FITARA requirements:] High risk rating. Given the size and complexity of the multi-billion dollar Federal IT Portfolio, it is critical to maintain a focus on the health of IT investments across the government. As required by CPIC guidance, the CIO evaluations reported to the ITDB for all major IT investments <span class="priority">must</span> reflect the CIO's assessment of the current level of risk for any major investment's ability to accomplish its goals based on factors described in the CPIC guidance.</p>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <span class="priority">will</span> be used to meet FITARA requirements:] TechStat Sessions. A TechStat is a face-to-face, evidence-based accountability review of an IT program with agency leadership. TechStat sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in an investment, turning around underperforming investments, or terminating investments if appropriate. For all agency-led TechStat reviews of investments, the agency <span class="priority">shall</span> contact egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line, " [Agency Acronym] TechStat Notification," at least two weeks ahead of the TechStat session.

<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <span class="priority">are expected</span> to:<br />� <span class="other">Define</span> and <span class="other">deliver</span> performance increases that matter to citizens -- Agencies are already required under OMB Circular A-11, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) to establish performance goals for IT and to link such goals to strategic plans. The E-Government Act builds on this process -- agencies <span class="other">are to</span> develop performance measures for e-government that are both citizen and productivity-related (see section 202). These performance measures <span class="priority">must</span> be linked with the agency�s Annual Performance Plan and the agency�s Strategic Plan and used to meet agency objectives, strategic goals, and statutory mandates in E-Government and IT.</p>
<p>[To <span class="priority">ensure</span> the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <span class="priority">requires</span> agencies to:] 2. <span class="priority">Ensure</span> Availability of Agency-Level and Award-Level Financial Data Sourced from Agency Financial Systems and Implement Linkage between Agency Financial System(s) and Management Systems Using Award IDs. To improve the quality of agencies' prime award-level Federal spending data required under FFATA, agencies <span class="priority">will be required</span> to make available financial obligation and outlay data, for both agency-level data (pursuant to Section 3(b) of FFATA, as amended) and award-level data (pursuant to Section 2(b)(l)(B) of FFATA) based on agency financial system(s).</p>
<p>[To ensure the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <span class="priority">requires</span> agencies to:] 3. <span class="action">Report</span> All Prime Financial Assistance Awards Above the Micro-Purchase<br />Threshold on a Bi-Weekly Cycle. Currently, pursuant to FFATA, Federal agencies <span class="action">report</span>, at least bi-weekly, transactions related to prime awards $25,000 or greater. Agencies <span class="priority">will be required</span> to submit specific programmatic information about all financial assistance and procurement prime awards greater than the micro purchase threshold (as defined by FAR 2.101) to USAspending.gov within two years of the date of this Memorandum. Agencies currently <span class="action">report</span> all procurement awards above the micro purchase threshold to FPDS-NG, which are made available via USAspending.gov, in accordance with current policy.</p>
<p>[To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act, this<br />Memorandum <span class="priority">requires</span> agency compliance with the following policies:] 2. Implement Data Definition Standards. OMB and/or Treasury <span class="priority">will</span> post data definition standards in a virtual repository. On the date of this Memorandum's issuance, this repository <span class="priority">will</span> serve as the authoritative source for such data definition standards pursuant to the DATA Act.

<p>[To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act, this Memorandum <span class="priority">requires</span> agency compliance with the following policies:] 3. Implement Data Exchange Standards. To publish Federal spending data on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), agencies <span class="priority">will</span> be <span class="priority">required</span> to provide data to Treasury under the "data-centric" approach using a standard data exchange ("DATA Act Schema"). This DATA Act Schema includes a standard taxonomy and a standard format, or "language", for exchanging data and provides a comprehensive view of the data definition standards and their relationships to one another. Treasury has created a draft DATA Act Schema for financial data based upon a subset of U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL). The schema is being further developed and refined based on feedback from federal and non-federal stakeholders and additional components <span class="priority">will</span> be created to capture award-level data elements. The Schema can be found here http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/dataexchange-standard/. The DATA Act Schema <span class="priority">will</span> be revised periodically to reflect statutory/regulatory changes and append additional data elements. Further, additional components of the DATA Act Schema that capture other data elements <span class="priority">will</span> be created in the future as needed.</p>

Figure 3 summarizes the Geospatial Data Lifecycle stages: Define Inventory/Evaluate, Obtain, Access, Maintain, Use/Evaluate, and Archive. Business requirements drive recommended management practices in each stage.</p>
<p>3.4.2. NGDA Theme Management - NGDA Theme Leads <span class="priority">should</span> comprehensively coordinate with their NGDA Dataset Managers to provide overall management for the NGDA Datasets associated with the NGDA Theme.</p>
<p>4.2. Implementation of the Roles and Responsibilities Framework - The roles and responsibilities contained in this Supplemental Guidance describe activities needed for successful NGDA Portfolio management.  All agencies <span class="priority">are encouraged</span> to make these roles and responsibilities operational, especially those agencies that have NGDA Theme Lead responsibilities.</p>
<p>5.2 The Process - Agency budget requests <span class="priority">should</span> reflect suggested FGDC investment collaboration status. Agency CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> be consulted to ensure alignment with respect to the agency�s CPIC process (May-September; Step 4).</p>
<p>5.2 The Process - The FGDC Steering Committee communicates its BY funding recommendations for NGDA Themes and their component NGDA Datasets, plus any corresponding performance recommendations, to OMB, the relevant members of the CFO community, Executive NGDA Theme Champions, and the NGDA Theme Leads via the Executive NGDA Theme Champions.

<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <span class="priority">encourage</span> agencies to: <br />Identify and proactively address legal, regulatory, technical, and other barriers to the use of prizes and challenges;</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <span class="priority">encourage</span> agencies to: <br />Increase their capacity to support, design, and manage prizes, potentially in collaboration with external partners.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <span class="priority">encourage</span> agencies to: <br />Select one or more individuals to identify and implement prizes and challenges, potentially in partnership with outside organizations, and to participate in a government- wide �community of practice� led by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and</p>
<p>Agencies also <span class="priority">should</span> plan for the post-prize phase, reinforcing the impact of an award with other investments and follow-up activities.  In some cases, it may be helpful and appropriate to increase the visibility of a prize by involving senior agency officials in the launch.  It may be further helpful in some instances for an agency to identify government actions that would increase the impact of the prize over the long-term.</p>
<p>Agencies considering prizes and competitions <span class="priority">should</span> consult with their general counsels concerning legal issues relevant to their agencies and to ensure that each use of a prize or competition is consistent with congressional authorization or appropriation.</p>
<p>Agencies may have authority to partner with outside entities such as foundations and nonprofit organizations that may elect to award cash prizes or other forms of recognition directly to the winners of government prize competitions.  A supplemental award from the private sector can increase the incentives for participation in a competition. An agency considering such partnerships <span class="priority">should</span> consult with its Office of General Counsel, and <span class="priority">should</span> specifically consider issues relating to its solicitation or gift acceptance authorities to ensure compliance with the rule against augmenting appropriations.</p>
<p>Agencies may have statutory authority to form partnerships with other agencies. See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. � 106(l)(6), 106(m) (providing FAA with the authority to enter into �other transactions� with and to accept �services, equipment, personnel, and facilities� from other Federal agencies).  Such authority may prove useful to agencies that want to further their statutory missions by working with or supporting other agencies� prize endeavors. If contemplating such a partnership, an agency <span class="priority">should</span> be sure to consult with its Office of General Counsel.</p>
<p>Agencies moving to financial management Federal Shared Service Providers (FSSPs) <span class="priority">should</span> consult with their FSSPs to identify appropriate timelines for inclusion in agency implementation plans required under this Memorandum. This linkage will facilitate timely reporting of award level financial data, reduce reporting errors, and serve as the primary mechanism moving forward for associating expenditures with individual awards as required by FFATA and the DATA Act.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also provide individuals with alternatives to third-party websites and applications. People <span class="priority">should</span> be able to obtain comparable information and services through an agency�s official website or other official means. For example, members of the public <span class="priority">should</span> be able to learn about the agency�s activities and to communicate with the agency without having to join a third-party social media website. In addition, if an agency uses a third-party service to solicit feedback, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> provide an alternative government email address where users can also send feedback.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also provide individuals with alternatives to third-party websites and applications. People <span class="priority">should</span> be able to obtain comparable information and services through an agency�s official website or other official means.

In addition, if an agency uses a third-party service to solicit feedback, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> provide an alternative government email address where users can also send feedback.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> be sure to comply with FACA�s requirements, where applicable, when establishing a method of selecting a prize or contest winner.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> carefully consider whether a competition will involve intellectual property and determine in advance how to assign the rights to such works between themselves and the winning contestants.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consult with their general counsels in determining how to assign intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> create or update existing IT investment baseline management policies within 90 days of issuance of this policy and develop training plans for personnel with investment oversight and program management responsibilities that at a minimum address the policies outlined in Appendix A of this memorandum.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> determine assurance levels using the following steps, described in Section 2.3 [ref. Req. 43.20]:<br />Conduct a risk assessment of the e-government system.<br />Map identified risks to the applicable assurance level.<br />Select technology based on e-authentication technical guidance.<br />Validate that the implemented system has achieved the required assurance level.<br />Periodically reassess the system to determine technology refresh requirements.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> evaluate the applicability of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to any prize-related activities.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> evaluate the applicability of the Privacy Act to any prize-related activities.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> evaluate the need for potential contests and prizes to comply with varying state laws.  To the extent that state laws apply to a Federal prize competition at all, be aware that states generally regulate contests of chance much more heavily than they do contests of skill, and that injecting any element of chance into the selection of a contest or prize winner may significantly alter the state legal requirements with which the agency must comply.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> monitor https.cio.gov and other public resources to keep apprised of current best practices.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> plan appropriately for all stages of prize development and administration.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> report financial assistance awards to individuals in an aggregate record. An aggregate record is created by taking a group of similar records and tallying the dollars based on a specific set of data fields in order to create one summary (or aggregate) record. The fields that are not used can be left blank. All transactions included in an aggregate record <span class="priority">should</span> belong to the same fiscal year. Agencies also may continue to report awards below the required reporting threshold in an aggregate record.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> take into consideration cost, security requirements, and application needs when evaluating cloud environments.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> think broadly about the role that effective partners can play in administering or publicizing contests.  It may be appropriate, where legally permissible, to seek Federal agency or non-federal partners to help meet agency goals.  Some or all of the following vehicles may, in appropriate circumstances, be worthy of consideration: Designing, administering, and paying for the prize internally within the agency; Providing a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract to an outside organization that covers some or all of the costs associated with the prize purse and prize administration; or Encouraging the formation of a public-private partnership to fund and administer a prize.</p>
<p>Agencies that enter into procurement contracts, issue grants, or enter into cooperative agreements regarding prize competitions <span class="priority">should</span> consider standard requirements for documentation, reporting, and audits, and the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. � 200 et seq.).</p>
<p>Agencies with OT authority <span class="priority">should</span> work with their Offices of General Counsel to determine whether this authority would be beneficial in structuring competitions.</p>
<p>Agency CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> also consider the following when selecting IT investments:<br />� delivering services and information to citizens electronically;<br />� reducing burden on citizens and businesses;<br />� determining that the investment is part of the agency�s modernization blueprint;<br />� ensuring interoperability of systems; and � simplifying business processes and reusing technology where applicable.</p>
<p>Agency business processes <span class="priority">should</span> fulfill the needs of citizens, and as such, an agency <span class="priority"><span class="priority">should</span> be</span> willing to reorganize the ways it conducts business transactions with the public in order to accomplish this goal. This may include expanding initiatives that the agency is already undertaking, such as those that are part of the agency�s implementation of the President�s Management Agenda. Any changes to agency business processes <span class="priority">should</span> further the President�s goal of a citizen centered government.</p>
<p>Agency plans <span class="priority">should</span> also describe the actions that will be necessary to resume orderly operations once appropriations are restored. In doing so, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> describe:<br />� Plans for restarting Information Technology (IT) systems and avoiding any data loss or interruption, which may include requiring that critical IT personnel report to work earlier than normal to ensure that IT systems are up and running as soon as possible;</p>
<p>Agency strategic planning <span class="priority">should</span> incorporate the requirement for regular software and product lifecycle refresh.</p>
<p>Aggregate demand to support leveraged buying events - Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> focus the bulk of their acquisition of laptops and desktops on publicized buying events to maximize the Government's collective buying power. A best practice is to host semi-annual buying events where requirements across agencies are consolidated to leverage buying and drive down costs, and the WCT [Workstation Category Team] will require this practice for GSA Schedule 70, NITAAC CIO-CS, and NASA SEWP. Furthermore, the WCT will work with GSA to create tools on the Acquisition Gateway to help organizations consolidate requirements to better leverage their spending. Agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, participate in these buying events.</p>
<p>All agencies, to include Small and independent agencies, <span class="priority">should</span> complete the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Inspector General, and Senior Agency Official for Privacy questions in DHS's CyberScope no later than November 13, 2015.</p>
<p>All browsing activity <span class="priority">should</span> be considered private and sensitive. An HTTPS-Only standard will eliminate inconsistent, subjective determinations across agencies regarding which content or browsing activity is sensitive in nature, and create a stronger privacy standard government-wide.</p>
<p>An agency without explicit prize authority might be able to conduct a contest and/or offer a prize if doing so bears a direct relationship to the agency�s statutorily authorized mission.  Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consult their general counsels to determine whether such a relationship exists.</p>
<p>As OMB has noted, "The individual's right to privacy must be protected in Federal Government information activities involving personal information." As agencies consider security-related restrictions to release, they <span class="priority">should</span> focus on information confidentiality, integrity, and availability as part of the agency's overall risk management framework. They are required to incorporate the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199 "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems," which includes guidance and definitions for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also consult with the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) program to ensure compliance with CUI requirements, the National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding/0 and the best practices found in Project Open Data. In addition to complying with the Privacy Act of 1974, the �-Government Act of2002, FISMA, and CIPSEA, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> implement information policies based upon Fair Information Practice Principles and NIST guidance on Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. For example, agencies must: <br />a. Collect or create only that information necessary for the proper performance of agency functions and which has practical utility; <br />b. Limit the collection or creation of information which identifies individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary for the proper performance of agency functions; <br />c. Limit the sharing of information that identifies individuals or contains proprietary information to that which is legally authorized, and impose appropriate conditions on use where a continuing obligation to ensure the confidentiality of the information exists; <br />d. Ensure that information is protected commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information;<br />e. Take into account other publicly available information when determining whether particular information <span class="priority">should</span> be considered PII (as defined in part I of this Memorandum).</p>
<p>As noted, a prize <span class="priority">should</span> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exemplar prizes, such as the Nobel Prize, define excellence within an area. Historically, most prizes have been exemplar prizes that recognize past general achievement in a field, but other prize designs may more effectively spur future innovation.</p>
<p>As noted, a prize <span class="priority">should</span> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exposition prizes help identify and promote a broad range of promising ideas and practices that may not otherwise attract attention, facilitating further development of the idea or practice by third parties. Successful exposition prizes can mobilize capital and institutions in support of ideas and practices developed during a prize competition. For example, the Director of National Intelligence sponsors the Galileo Award to encourage Federal employees to propose creative solutions for the Intelligence Community, and provides winners with a cash prize and the opportunity to brief senior officials on their ideas.</p>

When considering prizes, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Market stimulation prizes try to establish the viability of a market to address a potential market failure, mobilize additional human talent and financial capital to jumpstart the development of a new industry, or change public perceptions about what is possible. The goal of the Ansari X Prize, for example, was to serve as a catalyst for the private spaceflight industry.</p>
<p>As noted, a prize <span class="priority">should</span> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Network prizes build networks and strengthen communities by organizing winners into new problem-solving communities that can deliver more impact than individual efforts. One example would be a contest encouraging people worldwide to share their thoughts and ideas on a variety of topics of universal interest and then organizing participants into an active online community, creating a global, cross-cultural dialogue in furtherance of the public diplomacy mission of the United States.</p>

When considering prizes, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Participation prizes create value during and after the competition � not through conferral of the prize award itself but through their role in encouraging contestants to change their behavior or develop new skills that may have beneficial effects during and beyond the competition. As part of his �Educate to Innovate� campaign, for example, President Obama has highlighted the FIRST robotics competitions, which engage over 200,000 students, and are designed to motivate young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. A contest encouraging good nutrition on the part of school cafeterias or school children would be an example of a participation prize; contestants participate not necessarily to collect the reward, but for the fun and benefits of the competition itself.</p>
<p>As noted, a prize <span class="priority">should</span> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Point solution prizes aim to reward and spur development of solutions for a particular, well-defined problem. NASA, for example, is using an online �innovation marketplace� with 180,000 participants to spur solutions to problems such as forecasting solar activity, keeping food fresh in space, and developing a compact aerobic device for astronauts. An advance market commitment may be one vehicle for spurring specific solutions by providing a commitment to purchase a product that does not yet exist. In the private sector, for example, five governments and the Gates Foundation have pledged $1.5 billion to support the purchase of pneumococcal vaccines for children in developing countries, which could save the lives of 7 million children by 2030.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership [between Public and Private], government <span class="priority">should</span> work creatively and collaboratively with the private sector to identify tailored solutions that take into account both the need to exchange information and protect public and private interests and take an integrated approach to national and economic security. These solutions <span class="priority">should</span> identify clear, actionable objectives for the sharing of data and define standards for incident reporting.</p>
<p>Before an agency uses any third-party website or application to engage with the public, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> examine the third party�s privacy policy to evaluate the risks and determine whether the website or application is appropriate for the agency�s use. In addition, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> monitor any changes to the third party�s privacy policy and periodically reassess the risks.</p>

<p>By June 30, 2011, each agency <span class="priority">should</span> identify a senior official, who will be responsible for the customer service plan and related agency goals, to represent the agency on the Task Force and submit the appropriate contact information on the MAX customer service initiative site, https://max.omb.gov/community/x/200ZIg. Before final publication in October, participating agencies will conduct a peer review of their customer service plans.</p>
<p>C. By December 31, 2005, this search function [on agency's public website] <span class="priority">should</span>, to the extent practicable and necessary to achieve intended purposes, permit searching of all files intended for public use on the website, display search results in order of relevancy to search criteria, and provide response times appropriately equivalent to industry best practices.</p>
<p>D. By December 31, 2005, agency public websites <span class="priority">should</span> to the extent practicable and necessary to achieve intended purposes, provide all data in an open, industry standard format permitting users to aggregate, disaggregate, or otherwise manipulate and analyze the data to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Due to the recent government shutdown, the beginning of the reporting period was delayed. In consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), we have extended the reporting deadline from�December 31, 2013 to January 31, 2014 for the following: <br />1. Senior Agency Official (SAO) annual report: Progress towards specific goals or requirements in NARA/OMB M-12-18, Managing Government Records Directive. You <span class="priority">should</span> have received instructions and the template for the report on August 29, 2013. (SEE AC 29 2013: Senior Agency Official Annual Report Template). Reports <span class="priority">should</span> be sent to PRMD@nara.gov by Friday, January 31, 2014.</p>
<p>E. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> note the Interagency Committee on Government Information has provided to OMB recommendations for organizing, categorizing, and searching for government information.  By December 17, 2005, OMB will issue any necessary additional policies in this area.</p>
<p>Each agency <span class="priority">should</span> develop and issue an implementation policy through which the agency will require the use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for access to that agency�s facilities, networks, and information systems. <br /><br />The government-wide architecture and completion of agency transition plans must align as described in the Federal CIO Council�s �Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Roadmap and Implementation Guidance� (available at www.idmanagement.gov).</p>
<p>Each agency <span class="priority">should</span> develop and issue an implementation policy through which the agency will require the use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for access to that agency�s facilities, networks, and information systems.  Effective the beginning of FY2012, existing physical and logical access control systems must be upgraded to use PIV credentials, in accordance with NIST guidelines, prior to the agency using development and technology refresh funds to complete other activities.</p>
<p>Each agency <span class="priority">should</span> develop and issue an implementation policy through which the agency will require the use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for access to that agency�s facilities, networks, and information systems. Effective immediately, all new systems under development must be enabled to use PIV credentials, in accordance with NIST guidelines, prior to being made operational.</p>
<p>Ensuring agency credentials meet FIPS 201 requirements<br />All agencies must provide to GSA by January 19, 2007, a credential with their agency�s standard configuration. The credential will be tested by GSA who will provide test results and report any configuration problems requiring correction to the agency within three weeks of receipt. <span class="priority">Should</span> configuration problems exist, the agency must resubmit their standard credential for re-testing once required corrections are made. The resubmission <span class="priority">should</span> be within three weeks of receiving the initial test results from GSA. Otherwise, the agency needs to be able to demonstrate substantial progress is being made to address any test failures. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consider not issuing new credentials until all problems identified in testing are resolved.<br />The initial testing services are being provided by GSA at no cost to the agency. However, agencies may be responsible for reimbursing GSA if substantial GSA support is necessary to help agencies resolve any technical issues. Agencies not using a shared service program <span class="priority">should</span> access the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program website at http://fips201ep.cio.gov/dce.php for directions on submitting test credentials and necessary information to GSA for testing.</p>
<p>Executive agencies <span class="priority">are encourage</span>d to join the Data Centers listserv by emailing listserv@listserv.gsa.gov with no subject and "subscribe datacenters" in the body (from a .gov or .mil email address only).<br />In addition to addressing questions and comments via the Data Centers listserv, https://management.cio.gov will be updated with best practices and other resources as they become available.</p>
<p>Executive departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>
<p>Federal websites and services <span class="priority">should</span> deploy HTTPS in a manner that allows for rapid updates to certificates, cipher choices(including forward secrecy) protocol versions, and other configuration elements.</p>
<p>Federal, State, local, and tribal governments <span class="priority">should</span> work with industry to improve the plans and resources they have in place in advance to detect, prevent, and respond to significant cybersecurity incidents.</p>
<p>Financial assistance (Grants, loans, insurance, loan guarantees, cooperative agreements and other assistance) data <span class="priority">should</span> be submitted to the ASP [Award Submission Portal] using the Federal Assistance Awards Data System-PLUS (FAADS PLUS) format detailed at https:/ /submissions. usaspending. gov/content/ documents/U serGuide.pdf. This format is consistent with the reporting format for the Federal Assistance Award Database System (FAADS), for all financial assistance.</p>
<p>For the FY 2006 budget submission, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> use section I.D. of budget exhibit 300 to identify the required PM Level for each investment (e.g., does the project require a Level 1, 2 or 3 PM), and whether the assigned PM's qualifications have been validated against the CIO Council guidance. If the PM is in the process of being validated, or cannot be validated at the appropriate project level at this time, you <span class="priority">should</span> explain how (e.g., training, mentoring) and when the validation will be completed.</p>
<p>Government <span class="priority">should</span> be collaborative. Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government. Executive departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector. Executive departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> solicit public feedback to assess and improve their level of collaboration and to identify new opportunities for cooperation.</p>
<p>Government <span class="priority">should</span> be participatory. [...] Executive departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information. Executive departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also solicit public input on how we can increase and improve opportunities for public participation in Government.</p>
<p>Government-wide Coordination- The Federal CIO will work with the United States Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and the Administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to help improve the interoperability and openness of government information. To this end, the Federal CIO will work to establish an interagency working group supp01ted by the Federal CIO Council. The working group <span class="priority">should</span> focus on leveraging government-wide communities of practice to help with the development of tools that support information interoperability and openness through repositories such as Project Open Data. Part of this work <span class="priority">should</span> be to share best practices related to interoperability and openness within government (e.g., Federal, state, local, and tribal). These collaborations shall be subject to statutory limitations and conducted in a way that fully protects privacy, confidentiality, confidential business information, and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Historic practice in Federal IT system projects has been to attempt to address a wide range of needs at once through expansive process reengineering projects. The complexity involved in this approach has added substantially to costs, significantly increased risks and delayed implementation of all functionality, including the most critical needs. One of the benefits of the segmented approach outlined above is that it allows prioritization of needs and functionality. The most critical functionality can be delivered first while functions of lesser importance can be considered for subsequent delivery. Among other benefits, this process has been proven to cause a healthy reevaluation or reconsideration of secondary functions after critical functions are in place and being used. Therefore, revised projects plans <span class="priority">should</span> prioritize the most critical financial functions.</p>
<p>If an agency incorporates or embeds a third-party application on its website or any other official government domain, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> take the necessary steps to disclose the third party�s involvement and describe the agency�s activities in its Privacy Policy, as specified in this Memorandum.</p>

<p>If information is collected through an agency�s use of a third-party website or application, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> collect only the information �necessary for the proper performance of agency functions and which has practical utility.�10 If personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> collect only the minimum necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation, or executive order</p>
<p>In addition, a contractor <span class="priority">may</span> be able to conduct a prize competition among sub- contractors to encourage innovative means of satisfying the contract and achieving the agency�s procurement needs.  Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> work with their Office of General Counsel and procurement officials to structure competitions that are compliant with applicable rules and regulations.</p>
<p>In considering the use of prizes and challenges, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> have a clear idea of what they are trying to accomplish by supporting or encouraging the creation of a prize, and how the prize will help them achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In considering the use of prizes and challenges, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> have a clear idea of what they are trying to accomplish by supporting or encouraging the creation of a prize, and how the prize will help them achieve that goal. A prize <span class="priority">should</span> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring private innovation and change. Furthermore, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> plan appropriately for all stages of prize development and, where permissible, consider partnering with other entities that might administer, support, or catalyze the prize.</p>
<p>In developing their implementation plans agencies <span class="priority">should</span> estimate resource requirements, propose an implementation timeline, and identity any foreseeable challenges, such as competing statutory, regulatory or policy priorities, to fully implement the requirements of the DATA Act as identified in this guidance. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> provide suggestions to mitigate identified challenges as well as offer recommendations for how the implementation plans will manage costs and support agency investment planning.  In addition, all agencies, particularly those who are financial management Federal Shared Service Providers (FSSPs), <span class="priority">should</span> include specific information about anticipated costs and timelines necessary to implement this Memorandum. Agency and FSSP plans <span class="priority">should</span> consider existing information technology lifecycle planning, as well as requirements for collaboration with the Chief Information Officer under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). For agencies moving to FSSPs, implementation plans <span class="priority">should</span> align with the move to the FSSP.</p>
<p>In devising its final plan, [ref. Req. 90.01-90.02] each agency <span class="priority">should</span> use a transparent process for soliciting views from stakeholders, including federally funded researchers, universities, libraries publishers, users of federally funded research results, and civil society groups, and take such views into account.</p>
<p>In general, when an agency uses a third-party website or application that is not part of an official government domain, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> apply appropriate branding to distinguish the agency�s activities from those of nongovernment actors. For example, to the extent practicable, an agency <span class="priority">should</span> add its seal or emblem to its profile page on a social media website to indicate that it is an official agency presence.</p>

<p>In implementing the Act and this guidance, agency CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> consult key stakeholders throughout their agencies, including program and project managers, content managers, librarians, public affairs representatives, records managers, and human resources managers.</p>
<p>Legal issues can present significant policy challenges for agencies. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consider these issues when assigning transactions to assurance levels. Risk assessments <span class="priority">should</span> include the potential effects of illegal activities and process failures with respect to: agency enforcement priorities, agency programmatic interests, broader public interests such as national security, the environment, and economic markets.Some of these harms (e.g., financial loss or release of personal information) are described in each assurance level; others depend on the agency's programmatic interests. The risk analysis process is necessarily highly contextual, and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consider whether their systems present any distinctive risks.</p>
<p>Leveraging the work performed in support of the EGov/LoB Implementation Plans, agencies are to <span class="action">identify</span> IT investments being (or planned to be) modified, replaced, or retired due to agency use of an E-Gov or LoB initiative. Examples include legacy payroll systems being retired due to migration to the E-Payroll initiative and legacy travel systems being replaced due to migration to an E-Travel service provider. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also consult their E-Gov/LoB Implementation Plans, Exhibit 53s, and Exhibit 300s to <span class="action">identify</span> investments.</p>
<p>Moreover, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> avoid any improper Federal endorsement of products or services when creating contests and prizes.  See 5 C.F.R. 2635.702(c).  Federal endorsement is not improper when it is �[i]n furtherance of statutory authority to promote products, services or enterprises� or �[a]s a result of documentation of compliance with agency requirements or standards or as the result of recognition for achievement given under an agency program of recognition for accomplishment in support of the agency�s mission.�  Id. Thus, agencies contemplating contests or prizes that could lead to the appearance of Federal endorsement <span class="priority">should</span> examine their statutory authorities to determine if they have authority to promote products, services, or enterprises, or whether the contest or prize is offered �in support of� their statutory mission.  Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consult with their Offices of General Counsel on avoiding conflicts of interest and engaging in or permitting Federal endorsement, or the appearance thereof, in connection with government contests.</p>
<p>None - When developing NGDA Dataset BY funding recommendations, NGDA Theme Leads <span class="priority">should</span> take into account non-Federal sources of funding for the NGDA Datasets and the NGDA Dataset�s significance in meeting the needs of both Federal and non-Federal levels of government.</p>
<p>OMB Memoranda M-99-1813 and M-03-22 establish requirements for agency Privacy Policies. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> continue to comply with existing guidance and <span class="priority">should</span> also update their Privacy Policy to describe their use of third-party websites and applications, including: <br />i. the specific purpose of the agency�s use of the third-party websites or applications; <br />ii. how the agency will use PII that becomes available through the use of the third-party websites or applications; <br />iii. who at the agency will have access to PII; <br />iv. with whom PII will be shared outside the agency; <br />v. whether and how the agency will maintain PII, and for how long; <br />vi. how the agency will secure PII that it uses or maintains; and <br />vii. what other privacy risks exist and how the agency will mitigate those risks.  <br /><br />An agency <span class="priority">should</span> also, when feasible, provide links to the relevant privacy policies<br />of the third-party websites and applications being used.</p>

An agency <span class="priority">should</span> also, when feasible, provide links to the relevant privacy policies<br />of the third-party websites and applications being used.</p>
<p>Once baseline cost estimates for the identified investments are developed, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> begin measuring actual costs of those investments on an ongoing basis. We expect agencies to begin all cost measurement activities no later than September 30, 2006. Per OMB Memorandum M-05-23, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> already be managing and measuring projects to within ten percent of baseline goals through use of an EVM System compliant with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA STD-748 or, for steady-state projects, performing operational analyses.</p>
<p>Once finalized, each agency <span class="priority">should</span> post its public access plan [ref. Req. 90.01-90.02] on its Open Government website.</p>
<p>One of the major causes of IT system failure is insufficient oversight by senior management. Often in the Federal government, senior agency managers do not adequately monitor projects on an ongoing basis once they are underway. Proven best practices in this area include identifying up-front a series of milestones, warning flags, and stop points over the course of the segment lifecycle which, if deemed necessary, can cause the project to be suspended and returned to planning. Additionally, clear deliverables <span class="priority">should</span> be monitored closely and any delays in deliverables <span class="priority">should</span> automatically result in a more in-depth review of a project. Finally, mechanisms for review of project status by senior management <span class="priority">should</span> be built into a project plan. Revised agency projects plans <span class="priority">should</span> integrate these best practices into their oversight processes.</p>
<p>Overall, the management of agencies' public websites <span class="priority">should</span> be in compliance with Federal information resource management law and policy.</p>
<p>Overly burdensome systems may affect non-federal entities� use of the system diminishing anticipated benefits and lowering return on investment. If a technical solution for an assurance level is too costly or burdensome, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consider reducing the required assurance level and implementing management controls or business process adjustments to achieve the same level of assurance. If the cost cannot be reduced to an acceptable level through such risk mitigation approaches, then the agency may need to reconsider its vision for the e-authentication system.</p>
<p>Project segments <span class="priority">should</span> generally take no longer than 90 -120 days to achieve specific project milestones. Although all specific milestones may not deliver functionality, all such milestones must support the delivery of well defined functionality. The overall length of a development project <span class="priority">should</span> not exceed 24 months. Historically, Federal government IT projects have involved expansive, long-term projects that attempt to change almost every aspect of a business system at once. These projects have taken years, sometimes a decade, and have failed at alarming rates. The best practice in IT project design now focuses on the development of an overall, high-level system architecture with specific development projects working on tight timetables with clear deliverables that provide interim functionality. This approach simplifies planning, development, project management and oversight, and training. It reduces risk and allows changes in technology to be incorporated into later phases at lower costs.</p>
<p>Projects Subject to Review , all financial system modernization projects with $20 million or more in planned spending on development or modernization expenses shall be halted pending an agency re-evaluation and a subsequent review by OMB as noted below. In addition, as a part of this review, projects identified as high-risk by OMB <span class="priority">should</span> require more frequent assessment to include review of task orders or activities. Review of projects nearing completion may be abbreviated and will include consideration of the costs and benefits of implementing the policy within the project. Agencies that have previously completed modernization projects must refrain from moving into additional rounds of planning and development until OMB has approved a revised implementation plan for those projects consistent with this guidance. Lastly, OMB may review systems that have completed implementation when a failure occurs (e.g., the system fails in performing basic functions).</p>
<p>Resources- Policy implementation may require upfront investments depending on the maturity of existing information life cycle management processes at individual agencies. Agencies are encouraged to evaluate current processes and identify implementation opportunities that may result in more efficient use of taxpayer dollars. However, effective implementation <span class="priority">should</span> result in downstream cost savings for the enterprise through increased interoperability and accessibility of the agency's information resources. Therefore, these potential upfront investments <span class="priority">should</span> be considered in the context of their future benefits and be funded appropriately through the agency' s capital planning and budget processes. Some of the requirements in this Memorandum may require additional tools and resources. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> make progress commensurate with available tools and resources.</p>
<p>Section 9c of OMB�s GPEA guidance states agencies <span class="priority">should</span> plan how to minimize this risk by ensuring user approval of such information. Section 8c of the OMB Procedures and Guidance on Implementing GPEA includes guidance on minimizing the likelihood of repudiation.</p>
<p>Some Federal agencies already have policies that partially meet the requirements of this memo. Those agencies <span class="priority">should</span> adapt those policies, as necessary, to fully meet the requirements.</p>
<p>Some agencies are authorized to enter into �other transactions� (OTs), which may provide those agencies with the flexibility to structure prize competitions that draw in entities that do not traditionally do business with the Federal Government or to leverage private sector funding.  These authorities differ by agency, so those agencies that possess OT authority <span class="priority">should</span> consult their general counsels and examine their specific implementing regulations and guidance documents.</p>
<p>Specific non-core financial system requirements, previously published by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) and known as the JFMIP Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) series, <span class="priority">should be</span> regarded as guidance when defining system requirements for acquisition. The FFMSR requirements <span class="other">are</span> not part of the Federal financial management systems requirements for FFMIA and therefore should not be used to determine substantial compliance.</p>
<p>State, local, and tribal governments <span class="priority">should</span> consider the need to elevate cybersecurity as an issue by designating a single leader to ensure effective coordination between Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), and State Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs). The review team heard from representatives of the National Governors Association that cybersecurity is the weakest link in their efforts to protect critical infrastructure assets in their individual states. HSAs can spend funds under a number of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant programs for cybersecurity efforts, but historically grant funds to a large extent have not been prioritized for cybersecurity. State, local, and tribal governments <span class="priority">should</span> consider whether to elevate cybersecurity as an issue and <span class="priority">should</span> ensure that CIOs, CISOs, and HSAs coordinate to achieve a robust defensive posture.</p>
<p>The Administration <span class="priority">should</span> consider, in consultation with affected parties and Congress, developing tailored incentives for information sharing. These measures might include, as a last resort, regulatory measures as part of an integrated approach to satisfying society�s interests in robust and resilient critical infrastructures, civil liberties and privacy protections, and maintaining the fair and open economic markets that underlie the U.S. economic system. Privacy enhancing technologies such as encryption or controlled access authentication could ameliorate some risks in sharing information.</p>
<p>The Administration <span class="priority">should</span> partner appropriately with Congress to ensure adequate law, policies, and resources are available to support the U.S. cybersecurity-related missions.</p>
<p>The Federal government - in collaboration with State, local, and tribal governments and industry - <span class="priority">should</span> develop a set of threat scenarios and metrics that all can use for risk management decisions, recovery planning, and prioritization of R&D. Modeling and simulation capabilities <span class="priority"><span class="priority">should</span> be</span> developed to help exercise these plans and determine potential levels of damage.</p>
<p>The Federal government - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy communities - <span class="priority">should</span> build a cybersecurity-based identity management vision and strategy for the Nation that considers an array of approaches, including privacy-enhancing technologies. The Federal government must interact with citizens through myriad information, services, and benefit programs and thus has an interest in the protection of the public�s private information as well. Increased use of on-line transactions involving financial, health, and commerce require a basis for building trust between the parties to a transaction.<br />� The Nation <span class="priority">should</span> implement, for high-value activities (e.g., the Smart Grid), an opt-in array of interoperable identity management systems to build trust for online transactions and to enhance privacy.<br />� The National Science and Technology Council�s (NSTC�s) Subcommittee on Biometrics and Identity Management in 2008 published a report that provides a vision for future federal identity management and a series of research and development recommendations. The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> use this report as a starting point for identity management strategies.<br />� The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> work with international partners to develop policies that encourage the development of a global, trusted eco-system that protects privacy rights and civil liberties and governs appropriate use of law enforcement activities to protect citizens and infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> consider options for incentivizing collective action and enhance competition in the development of cybersecurity solutions. For example, the legal concepts for �standard of care� to date do not exist for cyberspace. Possible incentives include adjustments to liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> consider whether available alternative or reserve communications would be adequate in the event of a major disruption of information and communications infrastructure, particularly as information and communications networks converge. Replacement or repair of infrastructure may also require additional planning and resources, particularly in the event of physical damage to networks or hard-to-replace components of the power grid.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> continue the principle of �mission bridging� started under the CNCI. Departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> expand the sharing of expertise, knowledge, and perspectives about threats, tradecraft, technology, and vulnerabilities between network defenders and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement organizations that develop U.S. operational capabilities in cyberspace.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> continue to facilitate programs and information sharing on threats, vulnerabilities, and effective practices across all levels of government and industry. It is not enough for the information technology workforce to understand the importance of cybersecurity; leaders at all levels of government and industry need to be able to make business and investment decisions based on knowledge of risks and potential impacts. State, local, and tribal governments face similar issues. State governments often serve as incubators for innovation and thus may be able to provide lessons learned in managing information and communications infrastructure. The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> continue to work with industry to identify and disseminate effective practices in secure design and operation of information technology products.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> develop processes between all levels of government and the private sector to assist in preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber incidents by leveraging existing resources. To help build situational awareness related to the information and communications infrastructure, the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> leverage existing resources such as the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the 58 State and local Fusion Centers that have been set up around the country.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> ensure resources are available for full federal implementation of HSPD-12. The Federal government also <span class="priority">should</span> consider extending the availability of federal identity management systems to operators of critical infrastructure and to private sector emergency response and repair service providers for use during national emergencies.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> explore expanded sharing of information about network incidents and vulnerabilities with major allies, seeking bilateral or multilateral arrangements that improve cybersecurity consistent with the protection of other U.S. economic and security interests and the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> have a clear and authoritative cyber incident response framework that needs to be documented in a revised Cyber Incident Annex for the National Response Framework.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> improve its ability to provide strategic warning of cyber intrusions and attacks to the President. The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> continue to leverage the Nation�s long-term investments in the fundamental development of cryptologic and information assurance technologies and the necessary supporting infrastructure. These investments, along with other intelligence capabilities, are critical to national strategic warning for attacks through cyberspace. In addition, the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> identify any gaps in law enforcement capacity or investigative authority needed to defend the Nation�s infrastructure. Any new authorities would need to be consistent with the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> streamline, align, and provide resources to existing organizations to optimize their capacity to identify priorities, enable more efficient execution, and develop response and recovery plans.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> work with the private sector to define public-private partnership roles and responsibilities for the defense of privately owned critical infrastructure and key resources.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> work with the private sector to develop standards for incident reporting by private-sector network operators to the Federal government. Industry has expressed concerns about reporting cyber incidents to which they have fallen victim, including the potential for negative impacts from resulting shareholder concerns, market reactions, or regulatory action. One industry group has proposed a government-industry working group to define sector-specific cyber incident thresholds that warrant reporting to security officials. Use of such information by the government would require rules and oversight, particularly for the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties. Another way to increase reporting is through consideration of appropriate data breach notification laws that require notification to the public and to the government, including law enforcement entities that could pursue investigations. The Federal government also <span class="priority">should</span> examine the effectiveness and scope of existing reporting requirements for regulated markets.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span>:<br />� Develop a coordinated plan for national security and emergency preparedness communications capabilities over next-generation networks, including milestones and funding requirements;<br />� Develop options for additional services the Federal government could acquire or direct investments the government could make in the information and communications infra structure to enhance the survivability of communications during a time of natural disaster, crisis, or conflict;<br />� Coordinate with international partners and standards bodies to support next-generation NS/EP communications capabilities in a globally distributed next-generation environment; and<br />� Ensure that efforts associated with the development of Executive Branch continuity communications architectures and next-generation services programs are adequately staffed and resourced.</p>
<p>The Federal government, in partnership with educators and industry, <span class="priority">should</span> conduct a national cybersecurity public awareness and education. The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> lead the development and direct the implementation of this public awareness strategy and <span class="priority">should</span> seek endorsement by Congress; State, local, and tribal governments; the private sector; and the civil liberties and privacy communities. The strategy <span class="priority">should</span> involve public education about the threat and how to enhance digital safety, ethics, and security. This campaign <span class="priority">should</span> focus on public messages to promote responsible use of the Internet and awareness of fraud, identity theft, cyber predators, and cyber ethics. Past successful public safety campaigns such as Smokey Bear on fire safety and the Click It or Ticket campaign for seat belt safety could be used as a model to inform and persuade the public about the importance of cybersecurity. These public service campaigns <span class="priority">should</span> focus on making cybersecurity popular for children and for older students choosing careers. Celebrities, the generation that has grown up with the technology, and new types of media can play critical roles in delivering the message effectively.</p>
<p>The Federal government, the private sector, and other stakeholders together <span class="priority">should</span> define technology-neutral performance and security objectives for future infrastructure, both to meet its own requirements as a consumer as well as in its capacity as a steward of the public interest. The Federal government and its partners <span class="priority">should</span> create a family of coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives, customized by sectors and organizations. These objectives could consider different models of computing platforms or network control concepts, and the emergence of technology solutions from government, academic, or industry research programs.</p>
<p>The Federal government, with the participation of all departments and agencies, <span class="priority">should</span> expand support for key education programs and research and development to ensure the Nation�s continued ability to compete in the information age economy. Existing programs <span class="priority">should</span> be evaluated and possibly expanded, and other activities could serve as models for additional programs.</p>
<p>The ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] process <span class="priority">should</span> define roles, responsibilities, and resources for different departments and agencies with respect to incident response - harmonized or enhanced as necessary - recognizing the different aspects of incident response and the different strengths various communities�network security, law enforcement, intelligence, and military�bring to the table.</p>
<p>The ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] <span class="priority">should</span> develop clear, enforceable rules for timely reporting of incidents by departments and agencies to enable an effective and efficient interagency response.</p>
<p>The PIA <span class="priority">should</span> describe: i. the specific purpose of the agency�s use of the third-party website or application; ii. any PII that is likely to become available to the agency through public use of the third-party website or application; iii. the agency�s intended or expected use of PII; iv. with whom the agency will share PII ;v. whether and how the agency will maintain PII, and for how long;<br />vi. how the agency will secure PII that it uses or maintains;<br />vii. what other privacy risks exist and how the agency will mitigate those<br />risks; and<br />viii. whether the agency�s activities will create or modify a �system of records�<br />under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>The PIA <span class="priority">should</span> describe: i. the specific purpose of the agency�s use of the third-party website or application; ii. any PII that is likely to become available to the agency through public use of the third-party website or application; iii. the agency�s intended or expected use of PII; iv. with whom the agency will share PII ;v. whether and how the agency will maintain PII, and for how long;<br />vi. how the agency will secure PII that it uses or maintains;<br />vii. what other privacy risks exist and how the agency will mitigate those<br />risks; and<br />viii. whether the agency�s activities will create or modify a �system of records�<br />under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>The President <span class="priority">should</span> consider appointing a cybersecurity policy official at the White House, reporting to the NSC [National Security Council] and dual-hatted with the NEC [National Economic Council], to coordinate the Nation�s cybersecurity-related policies and activities. This individual <span class="other">would</span> chair the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] and lead a strong process in consultation with other elements of the EOP to resolve competing priorities and coordinate interagency development of policies and strategies for cybersecurity. The cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> participate in all appropriate economic, counterterrorism, and science and technology policy discussions to inform them of cybersecurity perspectives.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> be the White House action officer for cyber incident response (a similar role to the action officers who help the White House monitor terrorist attacks or natural disasters).</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> work with all levels of government, the private sector, and our international partners to develop strategies and plans to encourage the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions and ensure the security and resilience of infrastructure systems.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> work with departments and agencies to enhance the identification, tracking, and prioritization of international venues, negotiations, and discussions where cybersecurity-related agreements, standards, activities, and policies are being developed.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> work with departments and agencies to recommend coherent unified policy guidance where necessary in order to clarify authorities, roles, and responsibilities for cybersecurity-related activities across the Federal government.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> work with relevant departments and agencies and the private sector to examine existing public-private partnership and information sharing mechanisms to identify or build upon the most effective models. [Footnote:] These include organizations such as the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) and its constituent bodies such as the Enduring Security Framework, the Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) and Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs); the Federal Bureau of Investigation�s InfraGard; the U.S. Secret Service�s Electronic Crimes Task Forces; the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC); the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC); the Homeland Security Advisory Council; and the associated subcommittees and working groups.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span>, working with departments and agencies, strengthen and integrate interagency processes to formulate and coordinate international cybersecurity-related positions. In addition, the Federal government�continuing the long-term history of collaboration with the private sector�<span class="priority">should</span> develop a proactive engagement plan for use with international standards bodies. This <span class="other">would</span> include taking stock of current policies and coordinating the development, refinement, or reaffirmation of positions to ensure that the full range of cybersecurity-related economic, national security, public safety, and privacy interests are taken into account.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, <span class="priority">should</span>:<br />� Define procurement strategies through the General Services Administration, building on work by the National Security Agency for the Department of Defense, for commercial products and services in order to create market incentives for security to be part of hardware and software product designs, new security technologies, and secure managed services;<br />� Expand partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and international partners to maximize the market influence of these procurements;<br />� Work with Congress to identify mechanisms that would enable departments and agencies - under appropriate, limited situations - to incorporate threat information into acquisition decisions; and<br />�Work with industry to provide threat information and identify best practices for managing supply chain and insider risks, both from economic and threat perspectives.</p>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, working with the ICI-IPC, <span class="priority">should</span> determine the most efficient and effective method of developing and maintaining situational awareness and incident response capabilities. The CNCI effort <span class="priority">should</span> continue to improve federal network defenses but consider the need for adjustments or additions to implementation plans. In particular, the President�s cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span>:<br />� Work with the private sector to explore how best to apply technical capabilities to the defense of the national infrastructure and what legal framework would be required to ensure the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties.<br />� Review the operational concept and the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Center (NCSC) to determine whether its proposed responsibilities, resource strategy, and governance are adequate to enable it to provide the shared situational awareness necessary to support cyber incident response efforts<br />� Continue to pursue the goal of the Trusted Internet Connection program to reduce the number of government network connections to the Internet but reconsider goals and timelines based on a realistic assessment of the challenges. Some departments and agencies during the past two years made progress reducing the number of connections and beginning the deployment of systems that will help the Federal government prevent as well as detect malicious behavior. The government, however, still has considerable work to do before full capability is achieved and may need to consider additional policies to enable full implementation of the strategy<br />� Evaluate and continue, as appropriate - in ongoing consultation with the civil liberties and privacy community - pilot deployments of intrusion detection and prevention systems for the benefit of federal networks, evaluate the performance of these systems, and continue studies of the issues that would arise if such capabilities were used with State government systems. These sensors will be vital to gaining situational awareness for federal networks, and the government will benefit from any policy, legal, or technology lessons learned as these deployments move forward.<br />� Explore - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy community - additional, long-term architectures for intrusion detection and prevention systems.</p>
<p>The Server Name Indication extension to TLS allows for more efficient use of IP addresses when serving multiple domains. However, these technologies are not supported by some legacy clients. Web service owners <span class="priority">should</span> evaluate the feasibility of using this technology to improve performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government <span class="priority">should</span> invest in processes, technologies, and infrastructure that will help prevent cyber incidents. Options include increased security testing, investment in systems that automate or centralize network management, and more restricted connectivity to the Internet for some unclassified systems.</p>
<p>The United States <span class="priority">should</span> initiate a K-12 cybersecurity education program for digital safety, ethics, and security; expand university curricula; and set the conditions to create a competent workforce for the digital age. To help Achieve these goals, the Nation <span class="priority">should</span>:<br />� Promote cybersecurity risk awareness for all citizens;<br />� Build an education system that will enhance understanding of cybersecurity and allow the United States to retain and expand upon its scientific, engineering, and market leadership in information technology;<br />� Expand and train the workforce to protect the Nation�s competitive advantage; and<br />� Help organizations and individuals make smart choices as they manage risk.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority"><span class="priority">should</span> not</span> have operational responsibility or authority, nor the authority to make policy unilaterally. Using interagency coordination processes, the cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> harmonize cybersecurity-related policy and technology efforts across the Federal government, ensure that the President�s budget reflects federal priorities for cybersecurity, and develop a legislative agenda, all in consultation with the Federal government�s Chief Technology Officer and Chief Information Officer�along with the appropriate entities within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the NEC [National Economic Council].</p>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, <span class="priority">should</span> develop structural options to perform appropriate oversight, implementation, and other functions. These could include among others, developing a JIACTF-like function in OMB or elsewhere in the EOP, creating an entity similar to President Eisenhower�s Operations Coordinating Board, or establishing some other entity that, among other things, assists in assessing department and agency performance and oversees federal compliance with cybersecurity standards. Unless and until such an office is established, the work of the JIACTF [Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force] <span class="priority">should</span> continue.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, <span class="priority">should</span> consult with industry to understand the impact of laws and policies on business operations.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official�through the interagency policy development process�<span class="priority">should</span> prepare for the President�s consideration an updated national strategy to secure the information and communications infrastructure. The strategy <span class="priority">should</span> include continued evaluation of CNCI activities and build, where appropriate, on its successes. The national strategy <span class="priority">should</span> focus senior leadership attention and time toward resolving issues that hamper U.S. efforts to achieve an assured, reliable, secure, and resilient global information and communications infrastructure and related capabilities. The strategy <span class="other">would</span> assist government efforts to raise public awareness, renew and build international alliances and public-private partnerships, establish a more comprehensive national cyber response and recovery plan, and promote an aggressive research and development agenda that has the potential to result in new technologies that will enhance cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The risk analysis incorporates this by discussing the risks associated with criminal and civil violations, and harm to agency programs or the public interest. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> remember to consult appropriately with their counsel's office in their determination of this impact. When assessing this risk and designing a process, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consider single acts and patterns of action that could affect agency programs. For example, if sensitive information is available from an agency website, the agency <span class="priority">should</span> consider the effects of single acts and possible patterns of such activity when assessing risk levels. (18 U.S.C. 1029, 1030)</p>
<p>Therefore, the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> initiate a national public awareness and education campaign informed by previous successful campaigns. Further, similar to the period after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October, 1957, the United States is in a global race that depends on mathematics and science skills. While we continue to boast the most positive environment for information technology firms in the world, the Nation <span class="priority">should</span> develop a workforce of U.S. citizens necessary to compete on a global level and sustain that position of leadership.</p>
<p>This policy only addresses the establishment, management, and change to investment baselines. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> reference other OMB requirements, including Circular A-130 and the Capital Programming Guide, to describe full lifecycle management of IT capital investments.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary costs in the future, you <span class="priority">should</span>, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that all new IT procurements are IPv6 compliant. Any exceptions to the use of IPv6 require the agency's CIO to give advance, written approval. An IPv6 compliant product or system must be able to receive, process, and transmit or forward (as appropriate) IPv6 packets and <span class="priority">should</span> interoperate with other systems and protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6 modes of operation. Specifically, any new IP product or system developed, acquired, or produced must: <br />� Interoperate with both IPv6 and IPv4 systems and products, <br />� If not initially compliant, provide a migration path and commitment to upgrade to IPv6 for all application and product features by June 2008, and <br />� Have available contractor/vendor IPv6 technical support for development and implementation and fielded product management. <br /><br />The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) will develop, as necessary, a standard to address IPv6 compliance for the Federal government. Additionally, as necessary, the General Services Administration and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council will develop a suitable FAR amendment for use by all agencies.</p>
<p>To bring transparency and effective management to the overall portfolio for cybersecurity, OMB <span class="priority">should</span> use its program assessment framework to ensure departments and agencies use performance-based budgeting in pursuing cybersecurity-related goals. A formal program assessment framework for cybersecurity <span class="other">would</span> have departments and agencies define each program�s purpose and goal as well as identify metrics to evaluate whether goals are achieved. The CNCI [Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative] has used a variation on this approach successfully.</p>
<p>To create an unprecedented and sustained level of openness and accountability in every agency, senior leaders <span class="priority">should</span> strive to incorporate the values of transparency, participation, and collaboration into the ongoing work of their agency. Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the Government � such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations � to work together to define and to develop open government solutions. Integration of various disciplines facilitates organization-wide and lasting change in the way that Government works.</p>
<p>To ensure that agencies are able to meet or exceed the schedule and the goals of this policy, civilian CFO Act agency Chief Information Officers and Chief Acquisition Officers have joint, but unique, responsibilities for implementation. Working together, the CIOs and CAOs shall develop short transition and implementation plans that address both the new technical and new acquisition requirements set forth in this memorandum. <br /><br />CAOs and CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> also work together to develop a process for measuring and evaluating the technical and acquisition efficiencies and effectiveness (e.g., reductions in time to procure, improved interoperability, overall savings) of the new strategy.</p>
<p>To facilitate coordination, all federal departments and agencies <span class="priority">should</span> establish a point-of-contact in their respective executive suites authorized to interface with the White House on cybersecurity related issues.</p>
<p>To improve the quality of government information available to the public, senior leaders <span class="priority">should</span> make certain that the information conforms to OMB guidance on information quality and that adequate systems and processes are in place within the agencies to promote such conformity.  (Footnote: Information Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-554, section 515; see also, "Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies" (67 FR 8452) and your agency's Information Quality Act guidelines.)</p>
<p>To the extent feasible and consistent with applicable law and policy; agency mission; resource constraints; U.S. national, homeland, and economic security; and the objectives listed below, digitally formatted scientific data resulting from unclassified research supported wholly or in part by Federal funding <span class="priority">should</span> be stored and publicly accessible to search, retrieve, and analyze.</p>
<p>To the extent feasible and consistent with law; agency mission; resource constraints; U.S. national, homeland, and economic security; and the objectives listed below, the results of unclassified research that are published in peer-reviewed publications directly arising from Federal funding <span class="priority">should</span> be stored for long-term preservation and publicly accessible to search, retrieve, and analyze in ways that maximize the impact and accountability of the Federal research investment.</p>
<p>To the extent feasible, an agency <span class="priority">should</span> post a Privacy Notice, described below, on the third-party website or application itself. The Privacy Notice <span class="priority">should</span>: i. explain that the website or application is not a government website or application, that it is controlled or operated by a third party, and that the agency�s Privacy Policy does not apply to the third party; ii. indicate whether and how the agency will maintain, use, or share PII that becomes available through the use of the third-party website or application; iii. explain that by using the website or application to communicate with the agency, individuals may be providing nongovernment third parties access to PII; iv. direct individuals to the agency�s official website; and v. direct individuals to the agency�s Privacy Policy as described above. An agency <span class="priority">should</span> take all practical steps to ensure that its Privacy Notice is conspicuous, salient, clearly labeled, written in plain language, and prominently displayed at all locations where the public might make PII available to the agency.</p>
<p>To the extent feasible, an agency <span class="priority">should</span> post a Privacy Notice, described below, on the third-party website or application itself.

An agency <span class="priority">should</span> take all practical steps to ensure that its Privacy Notice is conspicuous, salient, clearly labeled, written in plain language, and prominently displayed at all locations where the public might make PII available to the agency.</p>
<p>To the extent practicable and subject to valid restrictions, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.</p>
<p>To the extent practical and subject to valid restrictions, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> proactively use modern technology to disseminate useful information, rather than waiting for specific requests under FOIA.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the President�s cybersecurity policy official, in collaboration with other EOP entities and the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> provide a framework for research and development strategies that focus on game-changing technologies that will help meet infrastructure objectives, building on the existing Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) strategies and other R&D-related work. The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> greatly expand coordination of these strategies with industry and academic research efforts to avoid duplication, leverage and synchronize complementary capabilities and agendas, and ensure that technology transitions and enters into the marketplace.<br />� To enhance U.S. competitiveness, the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> work with industry to develop migration paths and incentives for the rapid adoption of research and technology development, including encouragement of collaboration between academic and industrial laboratories.<br />� The Federal government, in collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders, also <span class="priority">should</span> use the infrastructure objectives and the R&D framework to help define goals for national and international standards bodies.</p>
<p>When agencies are evaluating whether to use third-party websites or applications, they <span class="priority">should</span> consult with their SAOP. OMB Memorandum M-05-08 provides that an agency�s SAOP shall have a �central policy-making role� and shall have �overall responsibility and accountability for ensuring the agency�s implementation of information privacy protections.�14 Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> confer with their SAOP at the earliest possible stage of their planning process, and consult with the SAOP through implementation and post implementation review.</p>
<p>When agencies are evaluating whether to use third-party websites or applications, they <span class="priority">should</span> consult with their SAOP. OMB Memorandum M-05-08 provides that an agency�s SAOP shall have a �central policy-making role� and shall have �overall responsibility and accountability for ensuring the agency�s implementation of information privacy protections.�14 Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> confer with their SAOP at the earliest possible stage of their planning process, and consult with the SAOP through implementation and post implementation review.</p>
<p>With respect to Offices of Inspectors General (OIG), this guidance <span class="priority">should</span> be implemented in a manner that does not impact the independence of those offices and the authorities Inspectors General have over the personnel, performance, procurement, and budget of the OIG, as provided in the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. App 3).</p>
<p>Working with the private sector, the Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> coordinate and expand international partnerships to address the full range of cybersecurity-related activities, policies, and opportunities associated with the information and communications infrastructure upon which U.S. businesses, government services, the U.S. military, and nations depend. New agreements between governments and industry may need to be documented to enable international information sharing as well as strategic and operational collaboration. The Federal government <span class="priority">should</span> increase resources and attention dedicated to conducting outreach and building foreign capacity. For example, the United States <span class="priority">should</span> accelerate efforts to help other countries build legal frameworks and capacity to fight cybercrime and continue efforts to promote cybersecurity practices and standards. The United States also <span class="priority">should</span> work with allies to ensure the stability and global interoperability of the Internet, while increasing security and reliability for all users.</p>
<p>[...] OFPP <span class="priority">should</span> work closely with senior agency leadership at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy (DOE) as they rollout their IT acquisition cadres in the next year. The next step, over the following 18 months, <span class="other">is</span> to scale the specialized IT acquisition cadre government-wide.</p>
<p>[...] the cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> help coordinate intelligence and military policies and strategies for cyberspace�including for countering terrorist use of the Internet�to ensure integration of all mission equities. The cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> engage external advisory bodies. Many advisory bodies touch on cybersecurity-related issues, including the National Security and Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC), and the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB). The cybersecurity policy official <span class="priority">should</span> review the responsibilities of these bodies and propose changes as necessary to optimize advice and eliminate unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p>[The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies will focus on the following initiatives:] Open Data.  Experts have calculated that the potential economic benefits of open data are in the trillions of dollars. The Federal government has made significant strides in opening up data to drive economic growth. Currently there are over 117,000 data sets available on  data.gov.  As a next step, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> improve the quality and types of datasets. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> continue to evaluate their enterprise data inventory, conduct outreach to understand the users of their data, improve customer feedback mechanisms, and release datasets�subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions.</p>
<p>[The following is language from ATTACHMENT: Privacy Principles in Conducting Inter-Agency Data Sharing, follow link for full attachment] <br />6. Minimization.<br />When dealing with paper records, it may be difficult to provide only certain data elements to other agencies, because of the need for manual redaction of other information. In the computer world, it is far easier to implement sharing of only a narrow range of information that is necessary to verify an applicant's eligibility for a program. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> analyze what data are needed for program purposes and make every effort to ensure that they transfer only that information.<br /><br />7. Accountability.<br />Data sharing programs <span class="priority">should</span> include mechanisms to ensure that agencies are accountable for adhering to these principles. Some of these measures are already found in the Privacy Act, which provides for civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also consider training programs that stress accountability and explain penalties for breaches of confidentiality. Especially for more sensitive data and more extensive data sharing arrangements, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> consider whether additional oversight mechanisms, such as self-audits, are justified.<br /><br />For example, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> establish procedures to ensure compliance with redisclosure limitations. One mechanism for assuring compliance would be to have the recipient agency certify on a periodic basis that it has examined practices regarding redisclosure and, if necessary, taken corrective action where improper redisclosures have occurred.<br /><br />8. Privacy Impact Assessments.<br />In the President's FY2001 budget, the President announced an initiative to make "privacy impact assessments," or "PIAs," a regular part of the development of new Government computer systems. A PIA is a plan to build privacy protection into new information systems, such as, for example, by asking systems personnel and program personnel to work through questions on data needs and data protection before the system is developed. The CIO Council has voted the IRS PIA a best practice; it is available as a reference at http://www.cio.gov.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Joint and Leveraged Authorizations ; Agencies <span class="priority">are encouraged to</span> use joint and leveraged authorizations whenever practicable.� Joint authorizations can be used when multiple agency officials either from the same agency or different agencies, have a shared interest in authorizing an information system or common controls.  The participating officials are collectively responsible and accountable for the system and the common controls and jointly accept the risks that may adversely impact agency operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.�</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Joint and Leveraged Authorizations ; Agencies choosing a joint authorization approach <span class="priority">should</span> work together on the planning and the execution of the Risk Management Framework tasks described in NIST SP 800-37 and document their agreement and progress in implementing the tasks.  The specific terms and conditions of the joint authorization are established by the participating parties in the joint authorization including, for example, the process for ongoing determination and acceptance of risk.� The joint authorization remains in effect only as long as there is mutual agreement among authorizing officials and the authorization meets the requirements established by Federal or agency policies.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also establish procedures to receive and address individuals� privacy-related complaints and inquiries.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> be accountable for complying with these principles and applicable privacy requirements, and <span class="priority">should</span> appropriately monitor, audit, and document compliance.  Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> also clearly define the roles and responsibilities with respect to PII for all employees and contractors, and <span class="priority">should</span> provide appropriate training to all employees and contractors who have access to PII.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> be transparent about information policies and practices with respect to PII, and <span class="priority">should</span> provide clear and accessible notice regarding creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, and disclosure of PII</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PII commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from its unauthorized access, use, modification, loss, destruction, dissemination, or disclosure.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> involve the individual in the process of using PII and, to the extent practicable, seek individual consent for the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, or disclosure of PII.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII if they have authority to do so, and <span class="priority">should</span> identify this authority in the appropriate notice</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a legally authorized purpose, and <span class="priority">should</span> only maintain PII for as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> provide individuals with appropriate access to PII and appropriate opportunity to correct or amend PII</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Fair Information Practice Principles ; Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> provide notice of the specific purpose for which PII is collected and <span class="priority">should</span> only use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII for a purpose that is explained in the notice and is compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected, or that is otherwise legally authorized.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix II  ; Risk Management Framework ; The categorization of information systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of PII will depend on the sensitivity of the PII, the privacy risks, and the associated risk to agency operations, agency assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.  Agencies <span class="priority">should</span> generally categorize information systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of PII at the moderate or high confidentiality impact level.</p>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.15-43.18] In some cases impact may correspond to multiple assurance levels. In such cases, agencies <span class="priority">should</span> use the context to determine the appropriate assurance level.</p>
<p>d. IT Training. CIOs <span class="priority">should</span> also ensure that the agency head�s responsibility to establish and operate IT training programs is consistent with the requirements of Section 209, which outlines IT development provisions for the Federal workforce, including IT training (see Section 209(b)).</p>
<h2>May</h2>
<p>3. Specific statutory reporting requirements. Agencies that are responsible for specific statutory provisions <span class="priority">may have</span> separate reporting requirements. Please consult the responsibilities and products outlined in Attachment B [see page 11-13] for additional reporting requirements that may apply to specific agencies.</p>
<p>Additional updates to the Agency IT Portfolio Summary and Agency Major IT Business Cases <span class="priority">may</span> be applicable after final budget release in order to reflect changes in funding levels due to enactment of appropriations. Specific instructions and deadlines for submitting updates, corrections, and final submissions of exhibits will be available on the OMB MAX Federal Community.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> also opt not to apply OMB cost principles since the prize awards are pre-determined and not based on costs.  Exceptions to standard requirements should be made on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> be able to conduct a procurement in a contest-like manner to encourage greater innovation and private sector participation, when the payment of a prize is for a good or service for the benefit of the government.   Where appropriate, an agency could thus use existing procurement authority, such as that provided by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Chapter 1), to issue a solicitation seeking offers that would have to meet certain technical criteria � essentially the rules of the contest � for which the agency would pay a fixed amount (the prize).  In situations where small monetary prizes or small procurements are considered (in particular, below the $100,000 simplified acquisition procedure threshold), agencies might also be able to leverage the flexibilities afforded by simplified acquisition procedures to allow for innovative, contest-based approaches to such procurements.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> consider applying all standard requirements pertaining to pre-award and audit requirements, and modifying � to the extent allowable by law � the requirements for post-award requirements and compliance with the OMB cost principles.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> have increased latitude to offer cash prizes in competitions that involve artistic design.  See Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 4-162 to 4-164. Any prize purse awarded must be related to the reasonable cost of producing the design. See id.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> have statutory authorities in areas such as public education, outreach, and the like that can serve as a basis for supporting prize competitions without providing funds.</p>
<p>Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> modify the post-award and cost compliance requirements with respect to program income and financial reporting.  This could include, for purposes of illustration and when legally allowable, a waiver of the requirement for recipients to file a final financial report since the awards are for fixed amounts.</p>
<p>Although agencies <span class="priority">may</span> consult with the DHS United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) on whether an incident is considered a �major incident�, it is ultimately the responsibility of the victim agency to make this determination.</p>
<p>As part of their consideration of using grants to facilitate prize competitions, agencies <span class="priority">may</span> examine their authority to make fixed obligation awards without requirements for Federal monitoring of actual costs.</p>
<p>Beginning 180 days after issuance of this memorandum, agencies <span class="priority">may</span> not budget any funds or resources toward initiating a new data center or significantly expanding an existing data center without approval from OMB OFCIO. [Footnote:] Data centers certified by GSA OGP as Inter agency Shared Service Provider data centers are excluded from this development freeze.</p>
<p>Depending on the objectives, types, and sizes of prize competitions to be awarded, agencies <span class="priority">may</span> be able to modify the standard requirements to better match the administration and purposes of these awards.</p>
<p>Once HSTS is in place, domains <span class="priority">can be</span> submitted to a "preload list used by all major browsers to ensure the HSTS policy is in effect at all times.</p>
<p>Subject to the requirements set forth below [ref. Reqs. 62.02-62.11], agencies <span class="priority">may</span> use third-party websites and applications to engage openly with the public. These websites and applications offer new tools that will help people to connect with their government, promoting the goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration.</p>
<p>Subject to the requirements set forth below, agencies <span class="priority">may</span> use third-party websites and applications to engage openly with the public. These websites and applications offer new tools that will help people to connect with their government, promoting the goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Authorizing Official ; Agencies <span class="priority">can</span> choose from several different approaches when planning for and conducting authorizations.  These include an authorization with a single authorizing official, an authorization with multiple authorizing officials, or leveraging an existing authorization (see Section 6j, Joint and Leveraged Authorizations).  Agencies <span class="priority">can</span>, at their discretion, include the CIO or the SAOP as a co-authorizing official with a senior agency official who has budgetary oversight for an information system or is responsible for the mission or line of business supported by the system being authorized for operation.  Regardless of the approach used, only Federal Government personnel may serve as an authorizing official.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Cybersecurity Framework ; in the course of managing information security risk using the established NIST Risk Management Framework and associated security standards and guidelines required by FISMA, agencies <span class="priority">can</span> leverage the Cybersecurity Framework to complement their current information security programs.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Joint and Leveraged Authorizations ; The leveraging agency <span class="priority">may</span> determine that additional security measures are needed and negotiate with the owning agency to provide such measures.  To the extent that a leveraged authorization includes an information system that creates, collects, uses, processes, stores, maintains, disseminates, discloses, or disposes of PII, leveraging agencies must consult their SAOP.  The SAOP <span class="priority">may</span> determine that additional measures are required to manage privacy risks prior to leveraging the authorization.</p>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security Control Baselines ; Agencies <span class="priority">may</span> also develop overlays for specific types of information or communities of interest (e.g., all web-based applications, all health care-related systems) as part of the security control selection process.  Overlays provide a specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting information as part of the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security control baselines.  The overlay <span class="priority">may</span> be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control baseline and can be applied to multiple information systems.</p>

<p>A financial event is any activity having financial consequences to the Federal government related to the receipt of appropriations or other financial resources; acquisition of goods or services; payments or collections; recognition of guarantees, benefits to be provided, or other potential liabilities; distribution of grants; or other reportable financial activities.</p>
<p>A financial management system includes the core financial systems and the financial portions of mixed systems necessary to support financial management, including automated and manual processes, procedures, and controls, data, hardware, software, and support personnel dedicated to the operation and maintenance of system functions. The following are examples of financial management systems: core financial systems, procurement systems, loan systems, grants systems, payroll systems, budget formulation systems, billing systems, and travel systems.</p>
<p>A financial system, hereafter referred to as a core financial system, is an information system that may perform all financial functions including general ledger management, funds management, payment management, receivable management, and cost management. The core financial system is the system of record that maintains all transactions resulting from financial events. It may be integrated through a common database or interfaced electronically to meet defined data and processing requirements. The core financial system is specifically used for collecting, processing, maintaining, transmitting, and reporting data regarding financial events. Other uses include supporting financial planning, budgeting activities, and preparing financial statements. Any data transfers to the core financial system must be: traceable to the transaction source; posted to the core financial system in accordance with applicable guidance from the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB); and in the data format of the core financial system.</p>
<p>A mixed system is an information system that can support both financial and non-financial functions.</p>
<p>A platform of �Security and Privacy� � Ensures this innovation happens in a way that ensures the safe and secure delivery and use of digital services to protect information and privacy.</p>
<p>A �Customer-Centric� approach � Influences how we create, manage, and present data through websites, mobile applications, raw data sets, and other modes of delivery, and allows customers to shape, share and consume information, whenever and however they want it.</p>
<p>A �Shared Platform� approach � Helps us work together, both within and across agencies, to reduce costs, streamline development, apply consistent standards, and ensure consistency in how we create and deliver information.</p>
<p>A. Administrative Offices and Programs. The E-Government Act establishes, in statute, the following:<br />1. The CIO Council (see Section 101, 44 U.S.C. �3603).<br />2. The Office of E-Government and Information Technology within OMB; the E-Government Administrator, also within OMB, heads the Office of E-Government and Information Technology (see Section 101, 44 U.S.C. �3602).<br />3. The E-Government Fund, which expands the current E-Government Fund being administered by the General Services Administration. (see Section 101, 44 U.S.C. �3604).</p>
<p>Accordingly, where grants or cooperative agreements are appropriate mechanisms under a given statute to distribute funds, then a �cash prize for a competition� <span class="other">could</span> potentially also be a type of grant or the subject of a cooperative agreement that <span class="other">could</span> be used if otherwise consistent with the specific authorizing statute for the grant.  Discretionary, competitive grant programs (in contrast to formula grants or block grants) may be best suited as vehicles for prize competitions, since discretionary, competitive grants are often authorized by statutes that do not specify the manner in which grant funds must be distributed.</p>
<p><span class="other">Account</span> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Fringe Benefits � Fringe benefits include retirement, insurance and health, Medicare, and miscellaneous benefit cost factors. The actual costs of these benefit cost factors should not be calculated separately; rather, <span class="other">apply</span> the standard fringe benefit rate of 32.85% to full and part-time labor positions� basic pay. Fringe benefits are not applied to temporary and intermittent civilian positions. For positions not covered by Civil Servant Retirement System or Federal Employee Retirement System (typically intermittent and temporary employees), <span class="other">apply</span> the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) cost factor of 7.65%. (Based on Section B.2.f)</p>
<p>Account for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Overhead Factor � <span class="other">Calculate</span> overhead by multiplying personnel costs, including fringe benefits (but not including the personnel liability insurance factor), by a standard overhead factor of 12%. (Based on Section B.5). To avoid double-counting of costs, do not <span class="other">apply</span> the full 12% overhead rate if any of your overhead costs are captured in your indirect labor and/or material and supply costs. Instead, please determine an alternate agency-specific overhead rate to account for all overhead costs not included in another cost category. Please document your rationale/methodology for determining this alternate overhead rate.</p>
<p><span class="other">Account</span> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Personnel Liability Insurance � The cost of personnel liability insurance is calculated by multiplying the total personnel-related costs, including fringe benefits, by 0.7%. (Based on Section B.4.f) 2 ATTACHMENT A - IT INVESTMENT COST MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK AUGUST 2006</p>
<p><span class="other">Account</span> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Prorated Labor � Personnel not 100% dedicated to the project are to be accounted for as part of total project labor costs. Prorate the cost of those personnel based on the amount of time they spend on the project. For calculation purposes, <span class="other">use</span> either the actual hours or percentage of time spent on the project. (Based on Section B.2.b)</p>

<p>Agency-wide critical element(s) <span class="definition">included</span> in all bureau CIOs� performance evaluations - By December 31, 2015</p>
<p>Although some Federal websites currently use HTTPS, there has not been a consistent policy in this area. An HTTPS-only mandate will provide the public with a consistent, private browsing experience and position the Federal Government as a leader in Internet security.</p>
<p>An agency is, however, permitted to <span class="other">ask</span> the general public about ideas for improving current practices, and these general requests do not become subject to the PRA merely because they take the form of a contest, or because the agency announces that it will give a prize to those with the best ideas.</p>
<p>An �Information-Centric� approach � Moves us from managing �documents� to managing discrete pieces of open data and content which can be tagged, shared, secured, mashed up and presented in the way that is most useful for the consumer of that information. [Footnote:] Open data and content for the purposes of this document refers to digital information that is structured and exposed in a way that makes it accessible for meaningful use beyond its system of origin, be that internal to the government or external to the public.</p>
<p>As a general matter, if an agency is directing identical questions to, or imposing identical recordkeeping requirements on, ten or more persons, then such an information collection is subject to the PRA (44 U.S.C. � 3501 et seq.; 5 C.F.R. Part 1320).</p>
<p>Automatic OMB performance and budgetary actions - Completion of four consecutive quarters where CIO evaluation is still �Red� following an automatic TechStat (beginning July 1, 2015).</p>
<p>Automatic TechStat sessions for high risk rated investments (three months) - Within 30 days of the completion of the third month where CIO evaluation is �Red� (�three months� begins July 1, 2015).</p>
<p>B. Government-wide activities. The Act also <span class="other">authorizes</span> two government-wide activities, which have already been developed:<br />1. Digital Signatures. Section 203 requires agencies to �ensure that its methods for use and acceptance of electronic signatures are compatible with the relevant policies and procedures issued by the Director� of OMB. This requirement is being fulfilled through agency implementation of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), the ESIGN Act, and the E-Authentication initiative.<br />2. Firstgov.gov portal. Section 204 requires OMB to oversee the maintenance of �an integrated Internet-based system of providing the public with access to Government information and services,� which is being fulfilled through the Firstgov.gov portal. [includes a Federal Internet Portal]</p>
<p>B. This requirement recognizes the proper performance of agency functions includes an obligation for clear and unambiguous public notification of the agency's involvement in or sponsorship of its information dissemination products including public websites.  It also recognizes in certain limited circumstances other domains may be necessary for the proper performance of an agency function.</p>
<p>Bureau CIO - Official with the title or role of Chief Information Officer within a principal subordinate organizational unit of the agency, as defined in Section 20 of OMB Circular A-11, or any component organization of the agency (contrast with �agency<br />CIO�).</p>
<p>By September 30, 2006, agencies are to <span class="action">develop</span> a comprehensive baseline cost estimate for each investment identified. <span class="other">Use</span> the guidelines in the IT Investment Cost Measurement Framework (Attachment A) to <span class="action">develop</span> baseline cost estimates. Baseline cost estimates should include only current and planned/future costs associated with the identified investments � exclude costs associated with the <span class="other">use</span> of the related E-Gov/LoB initiatives (e.g., migration costs, service fees). <span class="action">Submit</span> the cost estimate to OMB using the Baseline Cost Reporting template (Attachment B). a. The IT Investment Cost Measurement Framework is intended to help agencies identify the full cost of performance to the government of an agency project or investment, including sufficient detail on the basis of the costs, and was developed based on the guidance and cost principles in Attachment C of OMB Circular A-76.2 b. Agencies should complete a separate template for each investment identified. Based on our experience with pilot projects, we anticipate it will take approximately 45 days to <span class="action">develop</span> baseline costs using the framework.</p>
<p>C. Cross-agency work. In addition, several requirements of the Act <span class="other">are</span> being achieved through cross-agency work that is being done under the E-Government initiatives.<br />1. Section 203: E-authentication<br />2. Section 206: Online Rulemaking<br />3. Section 214: Disaster Management/Project SAFECOM<br />4. Section 216: Geospatial One Stop.</p>
<p>C. The term "information technology" includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including provisioned services such as cloud computing and support services that support any point of the lifecycle of the equipment or service), and related resources.</p>

<p><span class="other">Collect</span> or create information in a way that supports downstream information processing and dissemination activities - Consistent with OMB Circular A-130, agencies must consider, at each stage of the information life cycle, the effects of decisions and actions on other stages of the life cycle. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, agencies must design new information collection and creation eff011s so that the information collected or created supports downstream interoperability between information systems and dissemination of information to the public, as appropriate, without the need for costly retrofitting. This includes consideration and consultation of key target audiences for the information when determining format, frequency of update, and other information management decisions.</p>

<p>Contract - A mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and<br />the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of<br />appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts<br />include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. � 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see Part 16. � FAR definitions</p>
<p>Create and maintain a public data listing- Any datasets in the agency's enterprise data inventory that can be made publicly available must be listed at www.[agency].gov/data in a human- and machine-readable format that enables automatic aggregation by Data.gov and other services (known as " harvestable files"), to the extent practicable. This should include datasets that can be made publicly available but have not yet been released. This public data listing should also include, to the extent permitted by law and existing terms and conditions, datasets that were produced through agency-funded grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements (excluding any data submitted primarily for the purpose of contract monitoring and administration), and, where feasible, be accompanied by standard citation information, preferably in the form of a persistent identifier. The public data listing will be built out over time, with the ultimate goal of including all agency datasets that can be made publicly available. See Project Open Data for best practices, tools, and schema to implement the public data listing and harvestable files.</p>

<p>Definitions [for use in Policy 75]<br />Data: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term "data" refers to all structured information, unless otherwise noted. <br />Dataset: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the  "dataset" refers to a collection of data presented in tabular or non-tabular form. <br />Fair Information Practice Principles: The term "Fair Information Practice Principles" refers to the eight widely accepted principles for identifying and mitigating privacy impacts in information systems, programs and processes, delineated in the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. <br />Government information: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, "government information" means information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of, by or for the Federal Government. <br />Information: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, the term " information" means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. <br />Information life cycle: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, the term " information life cycle" means the stages through which information passes, typically characterized as creation or collection, processing, dissemination, use, storage, and disposition. <br />Personally identifiable information: As defined in OMB Memorandum M-1 0-23 , 17 "personally identifiable information" (PIT) refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual ' s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-PIT can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available (in any medium and from any source) that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual. <br />Mosaic effect: The mosaic effect occurs when the information in an individual dataset, in isolation, may not pose a risk of identifying an individual (or threatening some other important interest such as security), but when combined with other available information, could pose such risk. Before disclosing potential PIT or other potentially sensitive information, agencies must consider other publicly available data - in any medium and from any source- to determine whether some combination of existing data and the data<br />intended to be' publicly released could allow for the identification of an individual or pose another security<br />concern.</p>

As appropriate, account for labor rate escalation and inflation. (Based on Sections B.2.a, B.2.k, and B.2.l of Circular A-76, Attachment C).</p>
<p>In determining the cost of government-performed work, please distinguish between work performed directly by the agency and work performed by another government organization on a �fee-for-service� basis (e.g., a shared service center). Within the Baseline Cost Reporting template, use the �(Government) Agency� column to indicate work performed directly by the agency and the �(Government) Service Fees� column to indicate work performed on a �fee-for service� basis. Additionally, for work performed on a �fee-for-service� basis, please indicate the service provider, the associated agency, and the methodology and algorithm for determining the service fee (e.g., fee per employee, fee per transaction, etc.).</p>
<p>In order to assure effective management for IT and minimize any disruption during the upcoming transition or any transition of leadership, please review the attached IT governance framework and summarize your agency�s current alignment with each element of the framework via signed memorandum by December 1, 2008. This summary may also include information on activities currently underway or other related management plans. OMB�s Office of EGovernment and Information Technology is here to assist you and your CIO in the implementation of this framework.</p>
<p>In particular, this framework includes the requirement for Heads of Departments and Agencies to consult with the Director of the Office of Management Budget (OMB) prior to appointing an Agency-Appointed CIO, and to advise the Director on matters regarding the authority, responsibilities and organizational resources of the CIO, per OMB Circular A-130 (published November 28, 2000), Section 9, Assignment of Responsibilities. Consultation with OMB on CIO appointments should be factored into your agency�s selection process, and OMB will ensure its input into such selections is expeditious.</p>
<p>In some cases initial capital cost may be small, with higher long-term maintenance cost. It is therefore important to assess the costs over the life cycle of the system. Authentication errors can result in significant costs to agencies and the public. These costs will be identified by the risk analysis set forth in section 2, and should be included in any cost/benefit analysis.</p>

<p>Open data: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term "open data" refers to publicly available data structured in a way that enables the data to be fully discoverable and usable by end users. In general, open data will be consistent with the following principles: <br />� Public. Consistent with OMB's Open Government Directive, agencies must adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted  by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions. <br />� Accessible. Open data are made available in convenient, modifiable, and open formats  that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing). Open data structures do not discriminate against any person or group of persons and should be made available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To the extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly available, and no restrictions should be placed upon their use. <br />� Described. Open data are described fully so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to understand their strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how to process them. This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that describe data), thorough documentation of data elements, data dictionaries, and, if applicable, additional descriptions of the purpose of the collection, the population of interest, the characteristics of the sample, and the method of data collection.<br />� Reusable. Open data are made available under an open license that places no restrictions on their use. <br />� Complete. Open data are published in primary forms (i.e., as collected at the source), with the finest possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements. Derived or aggregate open data should also be published but must reference the primary data . <br />� Timely. Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs. <br />� Managed Post-Release. A point of contact must be designated to assist with data use and to respond to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.</p>

<p>Section 508 of the Rehabi litation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (E&IT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs, which reduces barriers to job success and mobility. The law also helps to ensure that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. The purpose of this letter is to remind Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of their collaborative roles in this area and to suggest activities and tools to help agencies fulfill their responsibilities in implementing the law. <br /><br />The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to acquire accessible E&IT unless an exception applies and is documented. Consideration of the Section 508 standards must be part of the procurement planning process, market research, and requirements definition, and the standards must be included in all applicable solicitations. The General Services Administration (GSA), as part of their statutory requirement to provide technical support for Section 508, assesses the extent to which agencies properly include applicable Section 508 standards using a sampling process of solicitations posted on FedBizOpps over the past few months. Across all agencies, a recent assessment by GSA showed that only 3% of the solicitations that included E&IT properly included the Section 508 standards. While some of the solicitations sampled included references to Section 508, a compliant document must, among other requirements, articulate the specific 508 standards that apply to that solicitation. <br /><br />These results demonstrate we are not adequately incorporating applicable Section 508 standards when acquiring E&IT. CAOs and CIOs should review their procurement and information technology acquisition policies and procedures to validate that the Section 508 standards are appropriately considered and clearly stated in solicitation documents. CAOs should consider sampling agency procurements that include E&IT to ensure they properly specify the appropriate Section 508 standards. Procurements that do not meet the standards should be amended. The attachment includes the assessment criteria that GSA uses, and CAOs should consider using these or similar criteria in their sampling effort. <br /><br />CIOs also have specific obligations to help ensure the applicable Section 508 standards are included in procurements for E&IT. Section 8(b)(xiii) of OMB Circular A- 130, �Management of Federal Information Resources,� requires agencies to ensure selected systems or processes facilitate accessibility under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and CIOs are responsible for monitoring agency implementation.  Additionally, Sections 53 and 300 of OMB Circular A-11, �Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget,� instruct agencies to ensure IT capital planning and control comply with Section 508 requirements.2 CIOs should instruct agency project managers to review capital planning and investment control documentation for compliance with Section 508. <br /><br />As part of its ongoing technical assistance and sampling activities, GSA�s Office of Information Technology Accessibility and Workforce may contact your Section 508 coordinator and the points of contact listed in solicitations that appear not to be compliant to offer additional assistance. <br /><br />A resource available to agencies is the Buy Accessible Wizard at www.buyaccessible.gov. This free tool guides requiring officials through the steps necessary to conduct acquisitions that comply with Section 508. CAOs and CIOs may incorporate the use of this tool into their procurement procedures to improve compliance with the law. Another resource is www.Section508.gov, which has information and free on-line training courses.</p>
<p><span class="other">Sponsor</span> ongoing dialogue with interested parties (including state, local, and tribal governments, private and non-profit sectors, and the general public) to find innovative ways to use IT to improve the delivery of Government information and services (Sec 101, 3602)</p>
<p>Step 1:  Conduct a risk assessment of the e-government system.  Guidance for agencies in conducting risk assessments is available in A-130, Section 5 of OMB�s GPEA guidance and existing NIST guidance. The risk assessment will measure the relative severity of the potential harm and likelihood of occurrence of a wide range of impacts (to any party) associated with the e-government system in the event of an identity authentication error.<br />Note: An E-government system may have multiple categories or types of transactions, which may require separate analysis within the overall risk assessment.  An E-government system may also span multiple agencies whose activities may require separate consideration.<br />Risk analysis is to some extent a subjective process, in which agencies must consider harms that might result from, among other causes, technical failures, malevolent third parties, public misunderstandings, and human error.  Agencies should consider a wide range of possible scenarios in seeking to determine what potential harms are associated with their business process.  It is better to be over-inclusive than under-inclusive in conducting this analysis.  Once risks have been identified, there may also be ways to adjust the business process to mitigate particular risks by reducing the likelihood that they will occur (see Step 4).<br />Step 2:  Map identified risks to the required assurance level.  The risk assessment should be summarized in terms of the potential impact categories in Section 2.2.<br />To determine the required assurance level, agencies should initially identify risks inherent in the transaction process, regardless of its authentication technology.  Agencies should then tie the potential impact category outcomes to the authentication level, choosing the lowest level of authentication that will cover all of potential impacts identified.  Thus, if five categories of potential impact are appropriate for Level 1, and one category of potential impact is appropriate for Level 2, the transaction would require a Level 2 authentication.  For example, if the misuse of a user�s electronic identity/credentials during a medical procedure presents a risk of serious injury or death, map to the risk profile identified under Level 4, even if other consequences are minimal.<br /><br />Step 3:  Select technology based on the NIST e-authentication technical guidance. After determining the assurance level, the agency should refer to the NIST e-authentication<br /> <br />technical guidance to identify and implement the appropriate technical requirements.<br /><br />Step 4: After implementation, validate that the information system has operationally achieved the required assurance level.  Because some implementations may create or compound particular risks, conduct a final validation to confirm that the system achieves the required assurance level for the user-to-agency process. The agency should validate that the authentication process satisfies the systems�s authentication requirements as part of required security procedures (e.g., certification and accreditation).<br /><br />Step 5: Periodically reassess the information system to determine technology refresh requirements.  The agency must periodically reassess the information system to ensure that the identity authentication requirements continue to be valid as a result of technology changes or changes to the agency�s business processes. Annual information security assessment requirements provide an excellent opportunity for this. Agencies may adjust the identity credential�s level of assurance using additional risk mitigation measures. Easing identity credential assurance level requirements may increase the size of the enabled customer pool, but agencies must ensure that this does not corrupt the system�s choice of the appropriate assurance level.</p>
<p><span class="action">Submit</span> an updated Enterprise Roadmap to OMB [4/1/2013 and going forward]</p>
<p>The "Common Baseline" (Attachment A) <span class="action">provides</span> guidance on the CIO's and other Senior Agency Officials' roles and responsibilities for the management of IT. This Common Baseline <span class="action">provides</span> a framework for agencies to implement the specific authorities that FITARA <span class="action">provides</span> for CFO Act agency CIOs, and builds upon their responsibilities as outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. The Common Baseline also speaks to the roles and responsibilities of other Senior Agency Officials, as it is critical that these officials in each covered agency are engaged in the oversight of IT investments.</p>
<p>The Act creates the Office of Electronic Government and Information Technology in OMB, which is headed by a Presidentially appointed Administrator. The Administrator assists the Director of OMB and the Deputy Director for Management in implementing the requirements of the Act, by providing overall leadership and direction to the executive branch on electronic government.</p>
<p>The Administration believes that prizes and challenges have a number of potential benefits. Under the right circumstances, they may allow government to: <br />Establish an important goal without having to choose the approach or the team that is most likely to succeed; Pay only for results; Highlight excellence in particular domain of human endeavor to motivate, inspire, and guide others; Increase the number and diversity of the individuals, organizations, and teams that are addressing a particular problem or challenge of national or international significance; <br />Improve the skills of the participants in the competition; Stimulate private sector investment that is many times greater than the cash value of the prize; <br />Further a Federal agency's mission by attracting more interest and  attention to a defined program, activity, or issue of concern, and Capture the public imagination and change the public's perception of what is possible.</p>
<p>The FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] certification tests <span class="other">are to be</span> conducted as prescribed in the Core Federal Financial System Software Qualification Testing Policy issued by FSIO.</p>
<p>The Federal government <span class="other">could</span> also consider ways in which it <span class="other">could</span> focus more resources on research into possible �game-changing� areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based cybersecurity solutions. The Federal government <span class="other">could</span> also consider ways in which it <span class="other">could</span> focus more resources on research into possible �game-changing� areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based cybersecurity solutions.</p>
<p>The costing elements and descriptions as outlined in Section 3 apply to contractor-performed work as well. In many cases, the total value of the contractor-performed work will be available through the contract and associated monitoring mechanisms (e.g., EVM). To the extent possible, break out the total value of the contractor-performed work into the costing elements contained in the Baseline Cost Reporting template.</p>
<p>The financial management systems identified in Section 5 [see page 3] <span class="other">are</span> subject to the policies contained in OMB Circular No. A-130, "Management of Federal Information Resources" (hereafter referred to as Circular A-130).</p>
<p>The policies in this Circular apply to the financial management systems of all agencies in the executive branch of the government, including any executive department, military department, independent agency, government corporation, government controlled corporation, or other establishment. Agencies not included in the CFO Act are exempted from certain requirements as noted in Section 8 and Section 9.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended that Agencies: <br />1.Use their enterprise architecture and capital planning activities to plan for the deployment of IPv6-enabled network services; show how  they intend to use these services to power IPv6-enabled applications; commit to specific measureable improvements in agency performance; and reflect the same in their investment proposals.  <br />2.Leverage the guidance and common milestones provided in this document to develop an effective Transition Plan. <br />3.Set up test laboratories and/or prototype networks to acquire IPv6 experience and expertise. <br />4.Deploy secure IPv6-enabled network services,  as appropriate, during regular technology upgrade cycles.</p>
<p>These anonymous credentials have limited application and are to be implemented on a case- by-case basis. Some people may have anonymous and identity credentials. As general matter, anonymous credentials are appropriate for Levels 1 and 2 only.</p>
<p>This Memorandum <span class="action">provides</span> guidance to Federal agencies on current reporting requirements pursuant to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) as well as new requirements that agencies must employ pursuant to the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (Data Act). This Memorandum includes guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury under section 4(c) of FFATA, as amended.</p>
<p>This definition [ref. Req. 81.06] and this memorandum refer to the term "information technology," which for the purposes of this memorandum is defined as: A. Any services or equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency; where B. such services or equipment are 'used by an agency' if used by the agency directly or if used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires either use of the services or equipment or requires use of the services or equipment to a significant extent in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.</p>
<p>This document [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not confer, and may not be used to support, any right on behalf of any person or entity against the United States or its agencies or officials.</p>
<p>This document expands on Section 5 by instructing agencies how to implement e-authentication processes by outlining a process for assessing risk, describing four levels of identity assurance, and explaining how to determine the appropriate level of identity assurance.</p>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] applies to all such transactions for which authentication is required, regardless of the constituency (e.g. individual user, business, or government entity).</p>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] applies to remote authentication of human users of Federal agency IT systems for the purposes of conducting government business electronically (or e- government). Though that authentication typically involves a computer or other electronic device, this guidance does not apply to the authentication of servers, or other machines and network components.</p>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not address issues associated with �intent to sign,� or agency use of authentication credentials as electronic signatures.  For more information on electronic signatures, see the OMB guidance on implementing GPEA1  and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, Pub. L. No. 106-2292.</p>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not directly apply to authorization. Authorization focuses on the actions permitted of an identity after authentication has taken place. Decisions concerning authorization are and should remain the purview of the business process owner.</p>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not identify which technologies should be implemented. The Department of Commerce�s National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing complementary e-authentication technical guidance that agencies will use to identify appropriate technologies, based on the analysis process described here.</p>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] is intended to help agencies identify and analyze the risks associated with each step of the authentication process. The process includes (but is not limited to) identity proofing, credentialing, technical and administrative management, record keeping, auditing, and use of the credential. Each step of the process influences the technology�s overall conformance to the desired assurance level.</p>
<p>This guidance directs agencies to conduct �e-authentication risk assessments� on electronic transactions to ensure that there is a consistent approach across government. (see Attachment A). [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34]</p>
<p>This memorandum builds on the Administration's successful efforts and establishes a broad strategic sourcing initiative to ensure that all agencies <span class="other">manage</span> their acquisitions effectively and that, wherever possible, agencies join together to negotiate the best deal for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>This memorandum <span class="other">revises</span> those reporting procedures to now require agencies to report all incidents involving personally identifiable information to US-CERT within one hour of discovering the incident. You should report all incidents involving personally identifiable information in electronic or physical form and should not distinguish between suspected and confirmed breaches. US-CERT will forward all agency reports to the appropriate Identity Theft Task Force point-of-contact also within one hour of notification by an agency.</p>
<p>Throughout the Common Baseline: � All references to "CIO" refer to department/headquarters CIOs, and only references to "bureau CIO" refer to the CIO or official-with-CIO-duties within a bureau or any component organization of the agency (see definitions). � If an agency has a "budget officer" separate from the CFO, then references to "CFO" shall also refer to the budget officer. � If an agency has a "senior procurement executive" separate from the CAO, then references to "CAO" shall refer also to the senior procurement executive.</p>
<p>Tiered data centers <span class="other">are</span> defined as those that utilize each of the following: 1) a separate physical space for IT infrastructure; 2) an uninterruptible power supply; 3) a dedicated cooling system or zone; and 4) a backup power generator for prolonged power outages. All other data centers shall be considered non-tiered data centers.</p>

<p>To the extent that the authentication process captures information that is protected by the Privacy Act (because it is information about an individual that the agency retrieves by an individual's name or other identifier and thus is maintained in an agency Privacy Act system of records), the agency needs to comply with the Privacy Act with respect to such information.</p>
<p>Treating laptops and desktops like a commercial commodity will help the Government drive efficiency in this category. However, most agencies have some nuanced requirements that either do not neatly fit into the standard configurations profiles above or are not offered on these vehicles. As such, the goal of this policy is not intended to drive 100% of civilian spend to CMLC-approved contracts, but rather to phase in the policy over time to achieve a Governmentwide goal of 75% by the end of FY18 (agency rates may be higher depending on their needs and policies). The table below <span class="other">identifies</span> the phase-in requirements for the Government over time [shown as a list below]: <br /><br />FY 2016: 45%<br />FY 2017: 60%<br />FY 2018: 75%</p>
<p>Under the �necessary expense� doctrine, an agency <span class="other">has</span> reasonable discretion in determining how to carry out the objects of an appropriation. To qualify as a �necessary expense,� the expenditure must:  <br />(1) <span class="other">make</span> a direct contribution to carrying out either a specific appropriation or an authorized agency function for which more general appropriations are available; <br />(2) not be prohibited by law; and (3) not be an item that falls within the scope of some other appropriation or statutory funding scheme.  <br /><br />See Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 4-19 to 4- 29, 4-162 to 4-164 (discussing Comptroller General�s view of the �necessary expense� doctrine and government-sponsored contests).</p>

<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Determining Assurance Level: Compare the impact profile from the risk assessment to the impact profiles associated with each assurance level.  To determine the required assurance level, find the lowest level whose impact profile meets or exceeds the potential impact for every category analyzed in the risk assessment (as noted in step 2 below).</p>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Level 1:  Little or no confidence in the asserted identity�s validity. Level 2:  Some confidence in the asserted identity�s validity. Level 3:  High confidence in the asserted identity�s validity. Level 4:  Very high confidence in the asserted identity�s validity.</p>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Potential Impact Categories:  To determine the appropriate level of assurance in the user�s asserted identity, agencies must assess the potential risks, and identify measures to minimize their impact. Authentication errors with potentially worse consequences require higher levels of assurance. Business process, policy, and technology may help reduce risk. The risk from an authentication error is a function of two factors: potential harm or impact, and the likelihood of such harm or impact.  Categories of harm and impact include: Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation, Financial loss or agency liability, Harm to agency programs or public interests, Unauthorized release of sensitive information, Personal safety, Civil or criminal violations.</p>
<p>[ref.
