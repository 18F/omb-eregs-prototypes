<ul>
<li>
<p>To provide a cohesive policy towards baseline management, this memorandum integrates the requirements in OMB Circular A-11, Part 7, and Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 34.202 with Federal IT Dashboard practices and guidance, and <strong>rescinds</strong> Memoranda 04- 24 and 05-23.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This policy only addresses the establishment, management, and change to investment baselines. Agencies <strong>should</strong> reference other OMB requirements, including <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-130</a> and the Capital Programming Guide, to describe full lifecycle management of IT capital investments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> create or update existing IT investment baseline management policies within 90 days of issuance of this policy and develop training plans for personnel with investment oversight and program management responsibilities that at a minimum address the policies outlined in Appendix A of this memorandum.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Appendix A</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Per <a href="#not-implemented">FAR Subpart 34.2 and OMB�s Capital Programming Guide,</a> a supplement to Circular A-11, Part 7, agencies <strong>shall</strong> implement an Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) or baseline validation process as part of an overall investment risk management strategy. As part of this process, requested adjustments to an existing investment baseline (i.e. �rebaselining�) should only be made if the program manager can demonstrate a high probability of success and a benefit-cost result that justifies continued funding after comparison with the other alternatives in the portfolio and budget limitations. Agency policy <strong>shall</strong> address: (I) establishing an investment baseline; (II) rebaselining an investment; (III) notifying OMB of new and changed baselines; (IV) managing and monitoring baselines via the use of performance management systems, (V) Federal IT Dashboard reporting requirements; and (VI) policy specific for Major IT Programs of the Department of Defense.</p>

Graduated requirements for establishing a baseline based on the size, scope, and development methodology of the investment. <br />2. Governance relationships including specific organizations and roles within the agency for establishment, approval, management and change of baselines. <br />3. A baseline <strong>shall</strong> cover a useful system component or capability, at a minimum. Agencies should encourage investment lifecycles of manageable duration so that baselines remain relevant.<br />4. Baseline requests <strong>shall</strong> include, at a minimum:  Agencies should encourage investment lifecycles of manageable duration so that baselines remain relevant. a. A description of the business need for the proposed baseline. b. A description of performance measures, including baseline performance and proposed target performance c. A product oriented work breakdown structure and cost estimate for proposed activities <br />5. A baseline validation and approval process or Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). In addition to the requirements in <a href="#not-implemented">FAR Subpart 34.202</a>, the process must include: a. Pre-defined decision criteria to be used by the decision authority to determine if the plan is valid b. A requirement for the proposed baseline to be well-documented, comprehensive, complete, and credible and consistent with industry and government best practices. c. Documentation of risks associated with cost, schedule, technical performance and management.</p>

Acceptable reasons for rebaselining include:  <br />a. Significant change in investment goals (scope, requirements, objectives) resulting from internal or external management decisions, or changes in funding level or availability of funds (e.g. extended continuing resolution), or contracting (including contractual protests) <br />b. In the case where an incremental or iterative system development and planning lifecycle has been chosen for the investment, progressive elaboration may be necessary when transitioning from one iteration or increment to the next, as scope and objectives evolve. Such rapid evolution inherent to iterative development <strong>shall</strong> be approved by the Agency CIO. <br />c. Current baseline is no longer useful as a management tool for realistic performance measurement as variances are so high that they lose meaning <br />2. Description of changes to performance goals and measures <br />3. Summary of the changes in the investment�s scope and/or capabilities <br />4. Identification of contributing problems, why the current plan is not feasible, and remediation plans to prevent problem recurrence, if applicable <br />5. For major investments updated Analysis of Alternatives of the chosen alternative�s cost data at a minimum (or new analysis if any of the original alternatives are no longer valid) and related recommendation <br />6. Chronology of changes to an investment�s work breakdown structure and cost estimate detailing variance from the most recently approved baseline <br />7. Description of any contract implications or necessary actions assuring that the baseline accurately reflects contracting constraints and risks.</p>

The following should be included in the update: <br />1. General baseline information <br />a. Date of internal (agency) approval of the (re)baselining event (per the governance process) <br />b. Updated cost and schedule information for remaining tasks and newly planned tasks <br />c. Selection of reason for change to baseline, and brief summary of the rationale used for the (re)baselining event including changes to scope and/or capabilities <br />2. Additions/modifications/deletions of performance measures, as appropriate. The update to the IT Dashboard will be considered notification to OMB, and agencies should begin to report against the submitted baseline.</p>

Transparency on the Federal IT Dashboard. The Federal IT Dashboard is not intended to be a replacement or substitution of agency or contract required EVMS. Rather, the Federal IT Dashboard collects and creates visualizations of aggregate cost and schedule data for Major IT investments, among other performance data. Analysis of data represented on the Federal IT Dashboard should supplement existing investment control mechanisms within the agency. <br />a. Agencies are required to update cost and schedule data for major Investments on a monthly basis; performance measurement data when actual data has been measured (annually, at a minimum), and CIO Assessments and contract data when significant changes occur with the investment. <br />b. Agencies are encouraged to report a transparent view of the investment baseline on the Federal IT Dashboard (Level 3 of the WBS has been communicated as a guideline). Levels 1 and 2 typically do not provide enough information to describe the work to be accomplished in short enough duration that early warnings of investment performance can be identified. <br />2. Agencies are required to provide Earned Value reports on contracts requiring EVMS to the Federal IT Dashboard on a monthly basis to include the following data elements at a minimum<br />a. Associated Unique Project Identifier : <br />b. FPDS Contract Identifier <br />c. Planned Start and End Dates <br />d. Budget At Completion <br />e. Cumulative to Date: Budgeted Cost of Work Schedule, Budgeted Cost of Work Performed, Actual Cost of Work Performed <br />f. Cost Variance, Cost Performance Indicator <br />g.
