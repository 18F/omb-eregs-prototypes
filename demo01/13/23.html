<p class='context'>Publish Government Information Online</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To increase accountability, promote informed participation by the public, and create economic opportunity, each agency <strong>shall</strong> take prompt steps to expand access to information by making it available online in open formats.   With respect to information, the presumption <strong>shall</strong> be in favor of openness (to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> respect the presumption of openness by publishing information online (in addition to any other planned or mandated publication methods) and by preserving and maintaining electronic information, consistent with the Federal Records Act and other applicable law and policy. Timely publication of information is an essential component of transparency. Delays <strong>should</strong> not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable consequence of high demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>b</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the extent practicable and subject to valid restrictions, agencies <strong>should</strong> publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>c</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the extent practical and subject to valid restrictions, agencies <strong>should</strong> proactively use modern technology to disseminate useful information, rather than waiting for specific requests under FOIA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>d</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 45 days, each agency <strong>shall</strong> identify and publish online in an open format at least three high-value data sets (see attachment section 3.a.i) and register those data sets via Data.gov. These must be data sets not previously available online or in a downloadable format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>e</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days, each agency <strong>shall</strong> create an Open Government Webpage located at http://www.[agency].gov/open to serve as the gateway for agency activities related to the Open Government Directive and <strong>shall</strong> maintain and update that webpage in a timely fashion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>f</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Open Government Webpage <strong>shall</strong> incorporate a mechanism for the public to: i. Give feedback on and assessment of the quality of published information; ii. Provide input about which information to prioritize for publication; and iii. Provide input on the agency�s Open Government Plan (see 3.a.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>g</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong>shall</strong> respond to public input received on its Open Government Webpage on a regular basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>h</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong>shall</strong> publish its annual Freedom of Information Act Report in an open format on its Open Government Webpage in addition to any other planned dissemination methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>i</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency with a significant pending backlog of outstanding Freedom of Information requests <strong>shall</strong> take steps to reduce any such backlog by ten percent each year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>j</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong>shall</strong> comply with guidance on implementing specific Presidential open government initiatives, such as Data.gov, eRulemaking, IT Dashboard, Recovery.gov, and USAspending.gov.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Improve the Quality of Government Information</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To improve the quality of government information available to the public, senior leaders <strong>should</strong> make certain that the information conforms to OMB guidance on information quality and that adequate systems and processes are in place within the agencies to promote such conformity.  (Footnote: Information Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-554, section 515; see also, "Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies" (67 FR 8452) and your agency's Information Quality Act guidelines.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 45 days, each agency, in consultation with OMB, <strong>shall</strong> designate a high-level senior official to be accountable for the quality and objectivity of, and internal controls over, the Federal spending information publicly disseminated through such public venues as USAspending.gov or other similar websites. The official <strong>shall</strong> participate in the agency�s Senior Management Council, or similar governance structure, for the agency-wide internal control assessment pursuant to the Federal Managers� Financial Integrity Act.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>b</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB will issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a framework for the quality of Federal spending information publicly disseminated through such public venues as USAspending.gov or other similar websites. The framework <strong>shall</strong> require agencies to submit plans with details of the internal controls implemented over information quality, including system and process changes, and the integration of these controls within the agency�s existing infrastructure. An assessment will later be made as to whether additional guidance on implementing OMB guidance on information quality is necessary to cover other types of government information disseminated to the public.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>c</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 120 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB <strong>will</strong> issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a longer-term comprehensive strategy for Federal spending transparency, including the Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act and the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. This guidance <strong>will</strong> identify the method for agencies to report quarterly on their progress toward improving their information quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Create and Institutionalize a Culture of Open Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To create an unprecedented and sustained level of openness and accountability in every agency, senior leaders <strong>should</strong> strive to incorporate the values of transparency, participation, and collaboration into the ongoing work of their agency. Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the Government � such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations � to work together to define and to develop open government solutions. Integration of various disciplines facilitates organization-wide and lasting change in the way that Government works.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 120 days, each agency <strong>shall</strong> develop and publish on its Open Government Webpage an Open Government Plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities. Additional details on the required content of this plan are attached. Each agency�s<br />plan <strong>shall</strong> be updated every two years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>b</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days, the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Federal Chief Technology Officer <strong>shall</strong> create an Open Government Dashboard on www.whitehouse.gov/open. The Open Government Dashboard will make available each agency�s Open Government Plan, together with aggregate statistics and visualizations designed to provide an assessment of the state of open government in the Executive Branch and progress over time toward meeting the deadlines for action outlined in this Directive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>c</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 45 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB, the Federal Chief Information Officer, and the Federal Chief Technology Officer <strong>will</strong> establish a working group that focuses on transparency, accountability, participation, and collaboration within the Federal Government. This group, with senior level representation from program and management offices throughout the Government, <strong>will</strong> serve several critical functions, including: <br />i. Providing a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote transparency, including system and process solutions for information collection, aggregation, validation, and dissemination; <br />ii. Coordinating efforts to implement existing mandates for Federal spending transparency, including the Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act and the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act; and <br />iii. Providing a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote participation and collaboration, including how to experiment with new technologies, take advantage of the expertise and insight of people both inside and outside the Federal Government, and form high-impact collaborations with researchers, the private sector, and civil society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>d</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 90 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB <strong>will</strong> issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a framework for how agencies can use challenges, prizes, and other incentive-backed strategies to find innovative or cost-effective solutions to improving open government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Create an Enabling Policy Framework for Open Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this Directive <strong>shall</strong> be construed to supersede existing requirements for review and clearance of pre-decisional information by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to legislative, budgetary, administrative, and regulatory materials. Moreover, nothing in this Directive <strong>shall</strong> be construed to suggest that the presumption of openness precludes the legitimate protection of information whose release would threaten national security, invade personal privacy, breach confidentiality, or damage other genuinely compelling interests.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 120 days, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), in consultation with the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Federal Chief Technology Officer, <strong>will</strong> review existing OMB policies, such as Paperwork Reduction Act guidance and privacy guidance, to identify impediments to open government and to the use of new technologies and, where necessary, issue clarifying guidance and/or propose revisions to such policies, to promote greater openness in government.</p>
