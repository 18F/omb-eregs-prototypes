<p class='context'>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - International compatibility is an important aspect of the NSDI. Federal agencies <strong>will</strong> develop their international spatial data in compliance with international voluntary consensus standards, as defined by Circular <a href="#not-implemented">A-119</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - This set of data consists of themes of national significance (see Appendix E). Themes providing the core, most commonly used set of base data are known as framework data, specifically geodetic control, orthoimagery, elevation and bathymetry, transportation, hydrography, cadastral, and governmental units. Other themes of national significance are also an important part of the NSDI, and must be available to share with others. Additional data themes may be added with the approval of the FGDC.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - All spatial data collected or derived directly or indirectly using federal funds will have FGDC metadata.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - All spatial data collected by federal agencies or their agents, as described in section 5, <strong>will</strong> be made available through the Clearinghouse. Spatial data users <strong>will</strong> have access to the NSDI through the National Spatial Data Clearinghouse.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - Standards are common and repeated rules, conditions, guidelines or characteristics for data, and related processes, technology and organization. To broaden the global use of federal data and services, international standards and protocols <strong>must</strong> be used. NSDI is made possible by the universal use of standards and protocols for data development, documentation, exchange, and geospatial services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - No federal funds <strong>will</strong> be used directly or indirectly for the development of spatial data not complying with NSDI standards, as specified by FGDC.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - Federal agencies <strong>will</strong> promote and fully utilize partnerships that promote cost-effective data collection, documentation, maintenance, distribution, and preservation strategies, and that leverage federal and other resources. New collaborative efforts and partnerships <strong>are encouraged</strong>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)? - Federal agencies and the FGDC carry out the activities required to implement their responsibilities as described in section 8 of this Circular. Agencies <strong>will</strong> provide or develop the required technology and services required to enable and provide access to NSDI data and information. The OMB <strong>will</strong> work with affected budget offices to provide appropriate resources in support of these activities.</p>
