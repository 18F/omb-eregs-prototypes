<p>To ensure that IT shared services are implemented in a coordinated and expedited manner,<br />Federal Agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) <strong><strong>will</strong> submit</strong> an "Enterprise Roadmap" to OMB by August 31, 2012 that covers Fiscal Years (FY) 2012-2015 and includes:<br />(1) Business and Technology Architecture: a high-level, integrated description of the agency's business objectives and enabling IT capabilities across all operating units and program areas ï¿½ using enterprise architecture concepts and methods from the Common Approach to describe the agency-wide current architecture, future architecture, and transition plans. The transition plan <strong>will</strong> include a description of the two IT areas that Federal Agencies <strong>will</strong> migrate to a shared service model by December 31, 2012 in accordance with OMB guidance.<br />(2) IT Asset Inventory (Appendix 1): a list of IT assets agency-wide to include all IT systems and services that support mission, administrative, and commodity IT programs, using the Federal Enterprise Architecture Reference Model taxonomies provided in the Common Approach. For the August 2012 Enterprise Roadmap submission, this IT Asset Inventory is optional but highly recommended. The IT Asset Inventory <strong>will</strong> be required for Enterprise Roadmaps thereafter.<br />(3) Commodity IT Consolidation Plan (Appendix 2): a synopsis of the agency-wide IT investment portfolio review conducted annually using methods and tools provided in OMB <a href="#not-implemented">M-12-10</a>. For the August 2012 submission, Federal Agencies <strong>will</strong> include their final plan to consolidate commodity IT, as is required by OMB <a href="#not-implemented">M-12-10</a>.<br />(4) Line of Business Service Plan (Appendix 3): the Program Manager of each Federal-wide Line of Business <strong><strong>will</strong> submit</strong> a Plan to OMB via the Managing Partner agency's CIO that addresses increasing the quality and update of the IT shared services that are provided through that LOB by the end of FY 2013. The LOB Plan <strong>will</strong> follow guidance provided in the IT Reform Agenda's 25-Point Plan8 and the IT Shared Services Strategy document that accompanies this memo.</p>

<p>Going forward, Federal Agency CIOs <strong>will submit</strong> an updated Enterprise Roadmap to OMB by April 1 each year. OMB will provide information sessions for Agencies and LOB Managing Partners for the development of the 2012 Enterprise Roadmap on a monthly basis from May to August, 2012. For Enterprise Roadmap submissions beginning with April 1, 2013, the following additional appendix will be included:<br />(5) IT Shared Service Plan (Appendix 4): a description, list, and transition plan for all intra-and inter-agency IT shared services that the agency intends to provide or consume during FY 2012-2015.</p>
