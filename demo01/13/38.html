</li>

</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Definition of Major Incident</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>FISMA 2014 requires OMB to define a major incident and directs agencies to report incidents designated as �major� to Congress within seven (7) days. This reporting should follow a process that takes into account the sensitivity of breach details and the classification level of the notification.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In determining whether a Major Incident has occurred, agencies <strong>shall</strong> consider whether the incident:  <br />1) Involves information that is Classified, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)  proprietary, CUI Privacy, or CUI Other; <br />2) Is not recoverable, not recoverable within a specified amount of time, or is recoverable only with supplemental resources; and <br />3) Has a high or medium functional impact to the mission of an agency; Or <br />4) Involves the exfiltration, modification, deletion or unauthorized access or lack of availability to information or systems within certain parameters to include either:  a) A specific threshold of number of records or users affected; 10,000 or more records or 10,000 or more users affected ; or  b) Any record of special importance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Additional Guidance and Processes for Reporting Major Incidents and Breaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Although agencies <strong>may</strong> consult with the DHS United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) on whether an incident is considered a �major incident�, it is ultimately the responsibility of the victim agency to make this determination.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the initial agency notification (about a Major Incident) DHS is <strong>required</strong> to notify OMB within one (1) hour of the relevant agency notifying DHS that a major incident has occurred.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> also notify Congress within 7 days of the date on which the agency has a reasonable basis to conclude that a major incident has occurred; the agency should also notify affected individuals, in accordance with FISMA 2014, as �expeditiously as practicable, without unreasonable delay.�</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the initial notification to Congress of a major incident, the agency <strong>must</strong> provide to Congress additional information on the threats, actors, risks, previous risk assessments of the affected system, the current status of the affected system, and the detection, response, and remediation actions that were taken as soon as this information is available.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Section II:  Improved Cybersecurity Preparedness and Coordination</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Enhancing Awareness of Cybersecurity Threat Activity</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All agencies <strong>must</strong> ensure that, at a minimum, the CIO and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) positions are designated as sensitive positions and the incumbents have Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Formalized Process for Providing On-Site, Technical Assistance to Federal Civilian Agencies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB directs agencies, consistent with applicable law, to <strong>provide</strong> the following to DHS by emailing rta@us-cert.gov by November 13, 2015:  <br />� A standing Federal Network Authorization. <strong>Ensure</strong> that such an authorization is reviewed on a semiannual basis and remains on file with DHS and will be activated by an email from the victim agency to DHS at the time of an incident;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OMB directs agencies, consistent with applicable law, to <strong>provide</strong> the following to DHS by emailing rta@us-cert.gov by November 13, 2015:  <br />���A technical point of contact, to be updated as necessary, to facilitate DHS scanning and protective activities within the scope of this memorandum;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Updated Reporting Requirements to Improve Agency Cybersecurity Preparedness</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> improve coordination with DHS, by:  <br />� Designating a principal Security Operations Center (SOC) and reporting this to DHS USCERT by emailing soc@us-cert.gov by November 13, 2015.  The principal SOC <strong>will</strong> be accountable for all incident response activities for that agency.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> improve coordination with DHS, by:  <br />��� Begin reporting their high value assets as first identified in the Cybersecurity Sprint to DHS for ongoing assessment.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> improve coordination with DHS, by:  <br />� Continuing to provide all public facing IP addresses to the DHS National Cybersecurity Assessment and Technical Services (NCATS) team at ncats@hq.dhs.gov for scanning as directed in <a href="#not-implemented">OMB M-15-01</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Incident Response Best Practices</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A successful response effort <strong>must</strong> align with the policies, procedures, and practices of the agency cyber program, which should support all five functions of the <a href="#not-implemented">NIST Cybersecurity Framework</a> (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover).</p>
