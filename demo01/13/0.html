<p class='context'>A. Apply �Light Technology� and Shared Solutions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> focus on consolidating existing data centers, reducing the need for infrastructure growth by implementing a �Cloud First� policy for services, and increasing their use of available cloud and shared services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.1 Identify agency data center program managers to lead consolidation efforts</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, each agency <strong>will</strong> designate a senior, dedicated data center consolidation program manager with project management experience and technical competence in IT infrastructure. Because data center consolidation requires interactions with many stakeholder groups, the data center program manager <strong>must</strong> also have strong communication skills. The data center program manager at each agency <strong>will</strong> be responsible for developing a plan with interim, verifiable milestones to reach the agency�s data center reduction target and monitor progress toward those goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.2  Launch a Data Center Consolidation Task Force to ensure successful execution</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next three months, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> launch a government-wide Data Center Consolidation Task Force comprised of the data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force <strong>will</strong> be responsible for working together to share progress toward individual agency goals and the overall Federal target of a minimum of 800 data center closures by 2015. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force <strong>will</strong> meet monthly to review progress of each consolidation project and ensure government-wide alignment between agency efforts where appropriate. The Task Force <strong>will</strong> serve as a �community of practice� for Agency CIOs and data center program managers to share best practices from this effort and enhance consolidation effectiveness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.3  Launch a publicly available dashboard to track data center consolidation progress</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB <strong>will</strong> launch a publicly available dashboard to serve as a window into progress of the data center consolidation program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2. Create a government-wide marketplace for data center availability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next 18 months, OMB and GSA <strong>will</strong> create a government-wide marketplace that better utilizes<br />spare capacity within operational data centers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3. Shift to a �Cloud First� policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning immediately, the Federal Government <strong>will</strong> shift to a "Cloud First" policy. The three-part strategy on cloud technology <strong>will</strong> revolve around using commercial could where feasible, launching private government clouds, and utilizing regional clouds with state and local governments where appropriate.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When evaluating options for new IT deployments, OMB <strong>will require</strong> that agencies default to cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable, cost-effective cloud option exists. To facilitate this shift, we will be standing up secure government-wide cloud computing platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.1 Publish cloud strategy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> publish a strategy to accelerate the safe and secure adoption of cloud computing across the government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <strong>will</strong> facilitate and lead the development of standards for security, interoperability, and portability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.2 Jump-start the migration to cloud technologies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Agency CIO <strong>will</strong> be required to identify three �<strong>must</strong> move� services and create a project plan for migrating each of them to cloud solutions and retiring the associated legacy systems. Of the three, at least one of the services <strong>must</strong> fully migrate to a cloud solution within 12 months and the remaining two within 18 months. Each migration plan <strong>will</strong> include major milestones, execution risks, adoption targets, and required resources, as well as a retirement plan for legacy services once cloud services are online. These new cloud implementations <strong>should</strong> be compatible with the secure, certified platforms currently provided in the private sector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4. Stand-up contract vehicles for secure IaaS solutions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, after completing security certification, GSA <strong>will</strong> make a common set of contract vehicles for cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions available government-wide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>5. Stand-up contract vehicles for commodity services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months, GSA <strong>will</strong> utilize [the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) E-mail Working Group] requirements to stand up government-wide contract vehicles for cloud-based email solutions. GSA <strong>will</strong> also begin a similar process specifically designed for other back-end, cloud-based solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>6. Develop a strategy for shared services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next 12 months, the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> develop a strategy for shared services. That strategy <strong>will</strong> build on earlier Federal Government successes in shared services and include benchmarks on current usage and uptake rates, as well as service level agreements (SLAs), customer satisfaction levels, costs, and overall economic effectiveness.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Managing partners of shared services <strong>will</strong> assess the current state of shared services and each release a roadmap to improve quality and uptake. Ultimately, the managing partners <strong>will</strong> be responsible for executing these roadmaps and <strong>will</strong> be held accountable for improvements on SLAs and reductions in cost. These efforts <strong>will</strong> enable the current shared services to be accessible government-wide at higher quality levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>PART II: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING LARGE-SCALE IT PROGRAMS</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Moving forward, Federal IT programs <strong>must</strong> be structured to deploy working business functionality in release cycles no longer than 12 months, and, ideally, less than six months, with initial deployment to end users no later than 18 months after the program begins.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Program managers <strong>need to</strong> define each phase of the IT development lifecycle and rigorously manage scope. These timelines <strong>should</strong> encompass the entire process -- from concept through requirement analysis, development, test, and delivery.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>B. Strengthen Program Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>7. Design a formal IT program management career path</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the next six months, OPM, with input from agencies and OMB, <strong>will</strong> create a specialized career path for IT program managers (PMs). This <strong>will</strong> likely require creating a separate Occupational Series specific to IT program management within the current IT family with career advancement paths that are more competitive with the private sector. The path <strong>should</strong> require expertise and experience for advancement. It <strong>will</strong> also require the development of a competency model for IT program management consistent with the IT project manager model. [...] In the next six months, OPM <strong>will</strong> work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for IT PMs as necessary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the next six months, OPM <strong>will</strong> work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for IT PMs as necessary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] agencies <strong>will</strong> identify specific IT program management competency gaps in the next Human Capital Management Report and develop specific plans to close the IT PM gap. To ensure that agencies are executing these plans, senior agency executives <strong>will</strong> review their progress and provide an interim report to OMB, 12 months after the next Human Capital Management Report is published.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OPM <strong>will</strong> work with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pilot the IT program management career track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>8. Scale IT program management career path government-wide</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After piloting IT program management career paths at Treasury and USDA, OPM <strong>will</strong> work to expand the IT program management career paths more broadly across the Federal Government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>9. Require integrated program teams</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next six months, OMB <strong>will</strong> issue guidance requiring an IPT [Integrated Program Teams], led by a dedicated, full-time program manager and supported by an IT acquisition specialist, be in place for all major IT programs before OMB <strong>will</strong> approve program budgets.[...] For major IT investments, agency leadership <strong>will</strong> approve the composition of the integrated program team and the dedicated program manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>9.1 Dedicate resources throughout the program lifecycle and co-locate when possible</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For each large IT program, critical members of the IPT [Integrated Project Team] <strong>will</strong> serve as full-time resources dedicated to the program. This <strong>must</strong> include a 100% dedicated IT program manager, but other roles <strong>will</strong> vary by program. Key members of the IPT <strong>will</strong> also be co-located during the most critical junctures of the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>9.2 Agencies will hold integrated program team members accountable for both individual functional goals and overall program success</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agency executives <strong>will</strong> work with their senior procurement executives (SPEs), CIOs, and program leaders to take action and drive towards a more balanced set of individual and program success metrics based on the following two recommendations:<br />� First, agencies <strong>should</strong> set up individual performance goals that cover individual and program objectives. Performance goals for acquisition, IT, and business personnel <strong>need to</strong> include a combination of individual and program objectives.<br />� Second, agencies <strong>must</strong> also ensure that the individual and program metrics balance speed, quality, effectiveness, and compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations. Supervisors <strong>must</strong> utilize a balanced set of performance metrics to evaluate individual performance. Individuals who provide exemplary contributions to the team <strong>will</strong> be recognized for their success (e.g., acquisition recognition through the Federal Acquisition Institute Awards & Recognition Program for individuals who effectively meet program needs without sacrificing compliance).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>10. Launch a best practices collaboration platform</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within six months, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> develop a collaboration portal to exchange best practices, case studies, and allow for real-time problem solving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>11. Launch technology fellows program</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months, the office of the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> create a technology fellows program and the accompanying recruiting infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>12. Enable IT program manager mobility across government and industry</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal CIO Council, OMB, and OPM, over the next 12 � 18 months, <strong>will be</strong> responsible for developing a process that will support and encourage movement of program managers across government and industry.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal CIO Council, OMB, and OPM <strong>will</strong> work to design opportunities for industry rotation to allow Federal program managers to remain up-to-date with the latest skills while managing conflict of interest issues.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To support PM mobility, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> build a repository of information on all Federal Government IT PMs, including relevant background, specific expertise, implementation experience, and performance as part of its best practices collaboration platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>C1. Align the Acquisition Process with the Technology Cycle</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>13. Design and develop a cadre of specialized IT acquisition professionals</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next six months, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the Federal CIO, with input from agencies, <strong>will</strong> design a specialized IT acquisition cadre.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>13.1 Strengthen IT acquisition skills and capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within six months, OFPP, with input from agencies, <strong>will</strong> develop guidance on requirements for IT acquisition specialists. In addition, OFPP <strong>will</strong> develop guidance on curriculum standards to cross-train program managers and IT acquisition professionals.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In particular, the guidance [issued by OFPP] <strong>will</strong> focus on increasing cross-functional knowledge of the IT marketplace, IT program management, and IT acquisition. OFPP <strong>will</strong> build upon its current Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) to develop a path for IT expertise. OFPP <strong>will</strong> leverage existing curriculum that may exist within agencies that already host specialized IT acquisition professionals. Skills development <strong>will</strong> include:<br />� Classroom training: OFPP <strong>will</strong> leverage and strengthen, where necessary, existing classes at the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), and engage these and other training providers to develop additional offerings as necessary.<br />� On-the-job experience: As is true with acquisition in general, the skills needed to successfully handle large IT acquisitions call for a blend of classroom training and on-the-job experience. For example, contracting professionals with hands-on IT experience are better equipped to help IT and program staff translate business and technical requirements into a statement of work that can help ensure a smooth procurement.<br />� Mentorship: Building a strong culture of mentorship enables IT acquisition professionals to more quickly learn �the art of the possible� to deliver effective IT acquisition solutions. OFPP can encourage this by building on FAI�s ongoing efforts to foster mentorship and networking opportunities, within and between agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As an immediate action to implement these recommendations, OFPP <strong>will</strong> consider these initiatives as part of its review of the Federal Acquisition Certifications for Program/Project Managers (P/PMs), Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTR), and contracting professionals in the next six months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>14. Identify IT acquisition best practices and adopt government-wide</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OFPP <strong>will</strong> lead an effort over the next six months to study the experience of those agencies that have already created specialized IT acquisition teams, in order to develop a model to scale more broadly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] OFPP <strong>should</strong> work closely with senior agency leadership at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy (DOE) as they rollout their IT acquisition cadres in the next year. The next step, over the following 18 months, <strong>is</strong> to scale the specialized IT acquisition cadre government-wide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>15. Issue contracting guidance and templates to support modular development</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next year, OFPP <strong>will</strong> work with the acquisition and IT communities to develop guidance on contracting for modular development. As part of this effort, OFPP <strong>will</strong> hold an open meeting with industry leaders to solicit ideas/feedback on contracting for modular development. OFPP <strong>will</strong> develop templates and samples, and <strong>will</strong> create communities of practice to facilitate adoption of modular contracting practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>16. Reduce barriers to entry for small innovative technology companies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of this effort, and to enable small IT companies to work with the Federal Government, SBA, GSA, and OFPP <strong>will</strong> take concrete steps over the next 18 months to develop clearer and more comprehensive small business contracting policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>C2. Align the Budget Process with the Technology Cycle</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>17.1 Analyze working capital funds and transfer authorities to identify current IT budget flexibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next six months, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with Congress to analyze existing working capital funds (WCFs) and other vehicles for pooling funds and extending availability of funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>17.2  Identify programs for which to pilot flexible budget models</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within six months, Agency CIOs and CFOs <strong>will</strong> identify programs at several agencies for which added budget flexibility could save money and improve outcomes. OMB and agencies <strong>will</strong> work with Congress to develop proposed budget models to complement the modular development approach. In addition, OMB and agencies <strong>will</strong> evaluate mechanisms for increased transparency for these programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>18. Develop supporting materials and guidance for flexible IT budget models</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to support agencies and appropriations staff in leveraging budget flexibility, the Federal CFO Council, in collaboration with the Federal CIO Council, <strong>will</strong> develop a set of best practices and materials that explain the need for these types of funding, and prescribe a path to achieving more flexible models. <br />As a first step, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> create a segmentation of common IT program types and the associated funding requirements. The Federal CFO Council <strong>will</strong> then work with the Federal CIO Council to create detailed �playbooks� mapping each IT program type to specific budget vehicles based on examples of past investments and IT needs (e.g., multi-year funding for programs with several discrete deliverables).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal CFO and CIO Councils <strong>will</strong> create a set of guidelines for increasing transparency in the utilization of IT funds. Agencies <strong>will</strong> follow these guidelines and institute additional review processes for multi-year funds and portfolio funding to prevent mismanagement of increased funding flexibility (e.g., masking program delays or overruns).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 1.41] Agencies <strong>will</strong> follow these guidelines and institute additional review processes for multi-year funds and portfolio funding to prevent mismanagement of increased funding flexibility (e.g., masking program delays or overruns).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>19. Work with Congress to scale flexible IT budget models more broadly</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months, OMB <strong>will</strong> engage several agencies to work with Congress to launch flexible IT budget models where appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>20. Work with Congress to consolidate commodity IT spending under Agency CIO</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with Congress to develop a workable funding model for �commodity� IT services. These funding models <strong>will</strong> be applicable to both inter-agency IT services and intra-agency IT services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 1.44] On an annual basis, the Agency CIOs and the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> identify �commodity� services to be included in this funding model as they are migrated towards shared services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>D. Streamline Governance and Improve Accountability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>21.1. Revamp IT Budget Submissions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By May of 2011, OMB <strong>will</strong> reconstruct the 300s and 53s [�] The timing of these elements <strong>will</strong> be separated into distinct streams to clarify objectives, give agencies adequate time to assemble strong responses, and improve data quality. These streams <strong>will</strong> include:<br />� Budget justification for new major Development, Modernization and Enhancement (DME) investments, significant re-engineering of existing DME investments, and annual re-justification of DME investments.<br />� Health monitoring of existing DME investments and Operations and Maintenance (O&M)<br />� Portfolio governance to ensure the IT portfolio and individual projects are consistent with the agency mission and Federal policy objectives</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Importantly, OMB and agencies <strong>must</strong> evaluate the way in which IT programs are reviewed so that budget approval for large IT programs is tied to key implementation steps rather than seemingly upfront, wholesale approval of massive programs.� OMB <strong>will</strong> evaluate ways to ensure agencies can demonstrate strong performance in earlier modules in order to receive approval for funding of subsequent modules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>21. Reform and strengthen Investment Review Boards</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By March 2011, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with Agency CIOs and other agency leaders to stand up the �TechStat� model at the departmental level. Steps include<br />� OMB <strong>will</strong> assist agencies in designing tools and enforcing their use, to provide the transparency required for the �TechStat� model to be effective.<br />� OMB analysts <strong>will</strong> provide in-person training to Agency CIOs in �TechStat� methodology including accountability guidelines, engagement cadence, evaluation processes, and reporting processes.<br />� Agency leaders <strong>will</strong> lead, sponsor, and manage the process within their departments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>22. Redefine role of Agency CIOs and Federal CIO Council</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agency CIOs <strong>will</strong> be responsible for managing the portfolio of large IT projects within their agencies. This portfolio management role <strong>will</strong> include continuously identifying unmet needs to be addressed by new projects, terminating or turning around poorly performing projects, and retiring IT investments which no longer meet the needs of the organization. Steps <strong>will</strong> include:<br />� As described above, Agency CIOs <strong>will</strong> take on responsibility for the �TechStat� governance process within their agencies as of March 2011.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> turnaround or terminate at least one-third of poorly performing projects in their portfolio within the next 18 months. The Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> play a similar portfolio management role, but at a cross-agency level. Within six months, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> periodically review the highest priority �TechStat� findings assembled by the Agency CIOs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>23. Rollout �TechStat� model at bureau-level</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Once cemented at the agency level, the "TechStat" model <strong>will</strong> be deployed at the bureau-level to ensure the effective management of large programs. Within 18 months, Agency CIOs, in collaboration with other agency leaders, <strong>will</strong> be responsible for deploying the tools and training necessary to ensure rollout has been completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>E. Increase Engagement with Industry</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>24. Launch �myth-busters� education campaign</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OFPP <strong>will</strong> identify the major myths that most significantly hinder requirements definition and the development of effective acquisition planning and execution. In January 2011, OFPP <strong>will</strong> issue a memorandum identifying these myths and the related facts and strategies to improve constructive engagement. This effort <strong>will</strong> be supported through discussions and other outreach efforts with key stakeholders in early 2011 including, but not limited to:<br />� Professional associations and other industry representatives.<br />� Federal stakeholders including program managers, contracting professionals, agency attorneys, and ethics officials.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Throughout 2011, the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and OFPP <strong>will</strong> conduct a �myth-buster� awareness campaign to eliminate artificial private sector engagement barriers. Steps <strong>will</strong> include at least the following:<br />� Launch an online community of practice within the next six months using technologies such as video channels to provide a Q&A forum, celebrate successes, and share �myths� and potential �myth-busters�<br />� Conduct FAI webinar for the acquisition workforce hosted by OFPP by late January 2011<br />� Create mandatory, continuous learning program through the FAI website<br />� Present at conferences such as the GSA Expo, the National Contract Management Association (NCMA) World Conference, and NCMA Government Contract Management Conference throughout 2011.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>25. Launch interactive platform for pre-RFP agency-industry collaboration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Inexpensive, efficient solutions such as these <strong>should be</strong> made available to all agencies to effectively tap the understanding of industry partners, especially in the period prior to issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP). Within the next six months, GSA <strong>will</strong> launch a government-wide, online, interactive platform for this purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>A. Apply �Light Technology� and Shared Solutions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>2. Create a government-wide marketplace for data center availability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next 18 months, OMB and GSA <strong>will</strong> create a government-wide marketplace that better utilizes spare capacity within operational data centers.
