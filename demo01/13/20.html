<p class='context'>Requested Agency Actions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Identify Impacted Investments</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Leveraging the work performed in support of the EGov/LoB Implementation Plans, agencies are to <strong>identify</strong> IT investments being (or planned to be) modified, replaced, or retired due to agency use of an E-Gov or LoB initiative. Examples include legacy payroll systems being retired due to migration to the E-Payroll initiative and legacy travel systems being replaced due to migration to an E-Travel service provider. Agencies <strong>should</strong> also consult their E-Gov/LoB Implementation Plans, Exhibit 53s, and Exhibit 300s to <strong>identify</strong> investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Develop Baseline Cost Estimates</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By September 30, 2006, agencies are to <strong><strong>develop</strong></strong> a comprehensive baseline cost estimate for each investment identified. <strong>Use</strong> the guidelines in the IT Investment Cost Measurement Framework (Attachment A) to <strong><strong>develop</strong></strong> baseline cost estimates. Baseline cost estimates should include only current and planned/future costs associated with the identified investments � exclude costs associated with the <strong>use</strong> of the related E-Gov/LoB initiatives (e.g., migration costs, service fees). <strong>Submit</strong> the cost estimate to OMB using the Baseline Cost Reporting template (Attachment B). a. The IT Investment Cost Measurement Framework is intended to help agencies identify the full cost of performance to the government of an agency project or investment, including sufficient detail on the basis of the costs, and was developed based on the guidance and cost principles in Attachment C of OMB Circular A-76.2 b. Agencies should complete a separate template for each investment identified. Based on our experience with pilot projects, we anticipate it will take approximately 45 days to <strong><strong>develop</strong></strong> baseline costs using the framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Measure Costs</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Once baseline cost estimates for the identified investments are developed, agencies <strong>should</strong> begin measuring actual costs of those investments on an ongoing basis. We expect agencies to begin all cost measurement activities no later than September 30, 2006. Per OMB Memorandum <a href="#not-implemented">M-05-23,</a> agencies <strong>should</strong> already be managing and measuring projects to within ten percent of baseline goals through use of an EVM System compliant with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA STD-748 or, for steady-state projects, performing operational analyses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>ATTACHMENT A - IT INVESTMENT COST MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>COST OF WORK (GOVERNMENT-PERFORMED)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In determining the cost of government-performed work, please distinguish between work performed directly by the agency and work performed by another government organization on a �fee-for-service� basis (e.g., a shared service center). Within the Baseline Cost Reporting template, use the �(Government) Agency� column to indicate work performed directly by the agency and the �(Government) Service Fees� column to indicate work performed on a �fee-for service� basis. Additionally, for work performed on a �fee-for-service� basis, please indicate the service provider, the associated agency, and the methodology and algorithm for determining the service fee (e.g., fee per employee, fee per transaction, etc.).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Personnel costs are costs associated with all personnel fully or partially involved in the project and include the following categories: � Direct Labor � Labor attributed specifically to a project � Indirect Labor � Labor in support of but not directly attributable to a project.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In determining labor costs, <strong>identify</strong> project staff and the associated wage/grade classifications and salary. <strong>Use</strong> actual resources assigned to the project, including both recurring and nonrecurring workload. As appropriate, account for labor rate escalation and inflation. (Based on Sections B.2.a, B.2.k, and B.2.l of Circular A-76, Attachment C).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Account</strong> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Prorated Labor � Personnel not 100% dedicated to the project are to be accounted for as part of total project labor costs. Prorate the cost of those personnel based on the amount of time they spend on the project. For calculation purposes, <strong>use</strong> either the actual hours or percentage of time spent on the project. (Based on Section B.2.b)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Account</strong> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Fringe Benefits � Fringe benefits include retirement, insurance and health, Medicare, and miscellaneous benefit cost factors. The actual costs of these benefit cost factors should not be calculated separately; rather, <strong>apply</strong> the standard fringe benefit rate of 32.85% to full and part-time labor positions� basic pay. Fringe benefits are not applied to temporary and intermittent civilian positions. For positions not covered by Civil Servant Retirement System or Federal Employee Retirement System (typically intermittent and temporary employees), <strong>apply</strong> the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) cost factor of 7.65%. (Based on Section B.2.f)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Account</strong> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Personnel Liability Insurance � The cost of personnel liability insurance is calculated by multiplying the total personnel-related costs, including fringe benefits, by 0.7%. (Based on Section B.4.f) 2 ATTACHMENT A - IT INVESTMENT COST MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK AUGUST 2006</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Account for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Overhead Factor � <strong>Calculate</strong> overhead by multiplying personnel costs, including fringe benefits (but not including the personnel liability insurance factor), by a standard overhead factor of 12%. (Based on Section B.5). To avoid double-counting of costs, do not <strong>apply</strong> the full 12% overhead rate if any of your overhead costs are captured in your indirect labor and/or material and supply costs. Instead, please determine an alternate agency-specific overhead rate to account for all overhead costs not included in another cost category. Please document your rationale/methodology for determining this alternate overhead rate.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Material and supply costs <strong>include</strong> all equipment (e.g., hardware, software) and supplies required by the investment. Please distinguish between the following: <br />� Existing Assets � <strong>Include</strong> the current value (depreciated as appropriate) of all materials and supplies. Additionally, <strong>provide</strong> an overview of the project lifecycle, indicating where the asset is in the project lifecycle. If an asset was not purchased by the project, but acquired on a different basis, please indicate the basis and account for costs accordingly. (Based on Sections B.3 and B.4) <br />� Planned Acquisitions � <strong>Include</strong> all planned acquisitions in materials and supply costs (e.g., hardware replacements, software license upgrades) required over the lifecycle of the project. <strong>Provide</strong> the methodology or basis used to determine the value of the planned acquisitions. (Based on Sections B.3 and B.4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>COST OF WORK (CONTRACTOR PERFORMED)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The costing elements and descriptions as outlined in Section 3 apply to contractor-performed work as well. In many cases, the total value of the contractor-performed work will be available through the contract and associated monitoring mechanisms (e.g., EVM). To the extent possible, break out the total value of the contractor-performed work into the costing elements contained in the Baseline Cost Reporting template.</p>
