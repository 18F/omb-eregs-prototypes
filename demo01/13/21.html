<p>This memorandum discusses validation and monitoring agency issuance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) compliant identity credentials. In support of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), guidance <strong>requires</strong> by October 27, 2007, agencies complete background checks on all current employees and contractors and issue PIV credentials with one exception. For individuals who have been Federal department or agency employees over 15 years, a new investigation and PIV credential issuance may be delayed, commensurate with risk, but must be completed no later than October 27, 2008. Identity credentials should be provided as outlined in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 and associated technical specifications.

Identity credentials should be provided as outlined in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 and associated technical specifications.<br /> By October 27, 2006, agencies were to begin issuing compliant credentials either through<br />the services of the General Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Interior (Interior) or by performing this function internally.</p>

<p class='context'>Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Ensuring agency credentials meet FIPS 201 requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensuring agency credentials meet FIPS 201 requirements<br />All agencies must provide to GSA by January 19, 2007, a credential with their agencyï¿½s standard configuration. The credential will be tested by GSA who will provide test results and report any configuration problems requiring correction to the agency within three weeks of receipt. <strong>Should</strong> configuration problems exist, the agency must resubmit their standard credential for re-testing once required corrections are made. The resubmission <strong>should</strong> be within three weeks of receiving the initial test results from GSA. Otherwise, the agency needs to be able to demonstrate substantial progress is being made to address any test failures. Agencies <strong>should</strong> consider not issuing new credentials until all problems identified in testing are resolved.<br />The initial testing services are being provided by GSA at no cost to the agency. However, agencies may be responsible for reimbursing GSA if substantial GSA support is necessary to help agencies resolve any technical issues. Agencies not using a shared service program <strong>should</strong> access the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program website at http://fips201ep.cio.gov/dce.php for directions on submitting test credentials and necessary information to GSA for testing.</p>

</ul>

<li>
<p class='context'>Quarterly status reports</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning March 1, 2007 and each quarter thereafter, agencies <strong>will</strong> post to their federal agency public website a report on the number of PIV credentials issued. Agencies must use the attached report template to distinguish between credentials issued to employees, contractors, and others (e.g., visiting scientists). The website address should be provided to OMB at eauth@omb.eop.gov by the due date. For agencies using GSA or Interior shared services, you may elect to have your service provider post your quarterly status to their public website.</p>
