<p class='context'>Section B: Implementation of the Common Baseline</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>1</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The "Common Baseline" (Attachment A) <strong>provides</strong> guidance on the CIO's and other Senior Agency Officials' roles and responsibilities for the management of IT. This Common Baseline <strong>provides</strong> a framework for agencies to implement the specific authorities that FITARA <strong>provides</strong> for CFO Act agency CIOs, and builds upon their responsibilities as outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. The Common Baseline also speaks to the roles and responsibilities of other Senior Agency Officials, as it is critical that these officials in each covered agency are engaged in the oversight of IT investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> institute policies and procedures that implement the roles, responsibilities, and requirements found in the Common Baseline [ref Req. 81.10].</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline: � Complete agency self-assessment and plan. Each covered agency <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> conduct a self-assessment that identifies current conformity with or gaps in conformity with the Common Baseline, and <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> articulate an implementation plan describing the changes it <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> make to ensure that all Common Baseline responsibilities described in Attachment A are implemented by December 31, 2015. This <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> include a discussion of how agency senior leaders and program leaders <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> work in partnership to facilitate the successful implementation of the Common Baseline and how the agency CIO <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> be enabled as a strategic partner integrated in shaping Agency strategies, budgets, and operations. The deputy secretary or chief operating officer or higher is responsible for the completion of the self-assessment and plan documents. This self-assessment and implementation plan <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> not exceed 25 pages and <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> include the template in Attachment C or another template approved by OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Each agency <strong>shall</strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:] Submit to OMB for acceptance of self-assessment and implementation plan. Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> submit this self-assessment and this implementation plan for review and approval to OMB's Office of E-Government & Information Technology (E-Gov) as well as to the agency's relevant OMB Resource Management Office no later than August 15, 2015. To fulfill this requirement, the agency deputy secretary or chief operating officer or higher <strong>is responsible</strong> for submitting these documents by email to egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line: �[Agency Abbreviation] <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> Common Baseline Implementation Plan." OMB <strong>may</strong> request additional information from agencies before the self-assessment and implementation plan are approved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 81.13] Agencies <strong>shall</strong> post the implementation plan portion of this document (posting the self-assessment is optional but encouraged) on their public website at agency.gov/digitalstrategy, and include it as a downloadable dataset in their Public Data Listing, no more than 30 days following OMB approval and thereafter keep the public document up to date with access to a history of previous versions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Each agency <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:] Support ongoing oversight of implementation plan and Common Baseline. Covered agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> follow OMB guidance from PortfolioStat sessions and other oversight activities regarding the ongoing implementation of the Common Baseline. Agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> notify OMB of any obstacles or incomplete implementation of the Common Baseline on an ongoing basis following the initial implementation deadline. OMB <strong>may</strong> request agencies to revise or update agency self-assessments or implementation plans during implementation as more information becomes available about the agency's management processes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Each agency <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:] Conduct annual review and update to self-assessment. Covered agencies <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> update the self-assessment annually to identify any obstacles or incomplete implementation of Common Baseline responsibilities that occurred over the preceding 12 months. The first update <strong>will</strong> be due April 30, 2016, and each April 30 on an annual basis thereafter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The following additional actions <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> be taken to support agencies' implementation of the Common Baseline: Federal CIO Council (the Council) <strong>shall</strong> develop and share on-going support and tools. Through the end of fiscal year (FY) 2016, the Council <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> dedicate time in its meetings to discuss current topics related to the implementation of the Common Baseline at least once every quarter. The Council <strong>should</strong> consult with the CFO Council in the development of materials to support changes related to the Common Baseline across management domains. The Council <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> also assist agencies in implementing the Common Baseline by sharing examples of agency governance processes and IT policies on a public website at https://management.cio.gov.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following additional actions <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> be taken to support agencies' implementation of the Common Baseline:] Support President's Management Council (PMC) follow-up. By June 30, 2015, the PMC <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> select three members from the Council to provide an update on government wide implementation of FIT ARA on a quarterly basis through the end of FY20 16. These updates <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> improve each agency's awareness of policies and processes which have worked well at other agencies.</p>

<p class='context'>Section C: Transparency, Risk Management, Portfolio Review, and Reporting</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>1</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to report required data to OMB as part of the quarterly IDC per current instructions. OMB <strong>will</strong> continue to update IDC instructions posted on the MAX Federal Community on a quarterly basis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Standardized cost savings metrics and performance indicators. As a part of the IDC reporting requirements, agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to provide cost savings and cost avoidance achieved as a result of strategies that the agency has decided to adopt. Based on this information, agencies <strong>will</strong> be provided a summary scorecard that provides agency-specific performance metric data and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing with the public and Congress. As required by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235)10 OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> continue to report quarterly to Congress on the cost savings, avoidance, and reductions in duplicative IT investments resulting from the above agency efforts. OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> also provide a summary of these savings by agency on a publicly accessible website. Agency reporting requirements for these topics are included in the IDC instructions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to provide information to the ITDB, as required by OMB's capital planning and investment control (CPIC) guidance, which is issued annually in conjunction with the release of OMB Circular A-11.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As a part of that [capital planning and investment control] guidance [ref. Req. 81.22], the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements: Monthly reporting. Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to provide updates of risks, performance metrics, project, and activity data for major IT investments to the ITDB as soon as the data becomes available, or at least once each calendar month.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] Data improvement program. If OMB or the agency CIO <strong>determines</strong> data reported to the ITDB is not timely and reliable, the CIO (in consultation with the agency head) <strong>must</strong> notify OMB through the IDC and establish within 30 days of this determination an improvement program to address the deficiencies. The CIO <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> collaborate with OMB to develop a plan that includes root cause analysis, timeline to resolve, and lessons learned. In addition, the CIO <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> communicate to OMB the steps the agency is taking to execute the data improvement program and the progress the agency is making. Agencies <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> provide updates on the status of this program on a quarterly basis as a part of their IDC submission until the identified deficiency is resolved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] TechStat Sessions. A TechStat is a face-to-face, evidence-based accountability review of an IT program with agency leadership. TechStat sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in an investment, turning around underperforming investments, or terminating investments if appropriate. For all agency-led TechStat reviews of investments, the agency <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> contact egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line, " [Agency Acronym] TechStat Notification," at least two weeks ahead of the TechStat session. Agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> follow the agency's TechStat policy and procedures based on the CIO.gov TechStat Toolkit when managing TechStat sessions. Agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> report the outcomes and outputs of all TechStat sessions through the quarterly IDC, including: the assessment described in Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework, a root cause analysis of performance issues, corrective action plans which address these causes, and a timeline for implementing the corrective actions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] High risk rating. Given the size and complexity of the multi-billion dollar Federal IT Portfolio, it is critical to maintain a focus on the health of IT investments across the government. As required by CPIC guidance, the CIO evaluations reported to the ITDB for all major IT investments <strong>must</strong> reflect the CIO's assessment of the current level of risk for any major investment's ability to accomplish its goals based on factors described in the CPIC guidance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  the capital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] Automatic TechStats. Moreover, if an investment has a high risk rating (red CIO evaluation in the ITDB) for three consecutive months beginning July 1, 2015, agencies <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> hold a TechStat session on that investment. The session <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> be held within 30 days of the completion of the third month. If this investment remains categorized with a red CIO evaluation one year following the Tech Stat session then OMB <strong>may</strong> take appropriate performance and/or budgetary actions until the agency has addressed the root cause and ensured the investment's ability to complete the remaining activities within planned cost and schedule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> hold PortfolioStat sessions on a quarterly basis with OMB, the agency CIO, and other attendees. (These sessions were previously annual and required the attendance of the agency deputy secretary (see Implementing PortfolioStat (M� 12-1 0), Fiscal Year 2013 PortfolioStat Guidance: Strengthening Federal IT Portfolio Management (M-13-09), and Fiscal Year 2014 PortfolioStat (M-14-08)). During these sessions, agencies <strong>will</strong>: � Discuss and update a multi-year strategy to identify and reduce duplication and waste within the IT portfolio of the agency, including component-level investments and to identify projected cost savings resulting from such strategy; � Identify or develop ways to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the IT investments of the agency; Identify or develop opportunities to increase the use of shared-service delivery models; � Identify potential duplication and waste; � Develop plans for actions to optimize the IT portfolio, programs, and resources of the agency; � Review investments included in High Impact Programs; and � Develop ways to better align the IT portfolio, programs, and financial resources of the agency to long term mission requirements or strategic plans required by law.</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>4</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> report the status of PortfolioStat action items in the IDC at least quarterly. Annually by April 30, agency heads <strong>shall</strong> review and certify the status of PortfolioStat action items with the agency CIO and send to OMB.

<li>
<p>IT Acquisition Cadres. FITARA' s requirements for IT acquisition cadres builds upon OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) July 2011 memorandum on building specialized IT acquisition cadres. As originally required by the memorandum, <a href="#not-implemented">Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic Plan for Civilian Agencies - FY 2010 - 2014 19 of October 27, 2009</a>, civilian CFO Act agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to send their annual Acquisition Human Capital Plans to OMB OFPP. The latest iteration of those Plans was due April 15, 2015.

<p>Category Management and the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative CFSSI). Agencies <strong><strong>will be required</strong></strong> to comply with an upcoming new rule regarding purchases of services and supplies of types offered under an FSSI agreement without using an FSSI agreement. In February 2015, the FAR Council initiated rulemaking to implement this provision of FITARA, which creates a preference for strategically sourced vehicles. Once finalized, agencies <strong><strong>will be required</strong></strong> to include in the contract file a brief analysis of the comparative value, including price and non-price factors, between the services and supplies offered under the FSSI and services and supplies offered under the source or sources used for the purchase. This rule will be in addition to other strategies that OFPP is developing around category management, a practice adopted by industry where spending is managed by categories of common spending, like IT and Transportation, and led by experts who promote government wide best practices and help agencies avoid unnecessary duplicative spending and activities.</p>

The CIO <strong>shall</strong> be involved in the recruitment and <strong>shall</strong> approve the selection of any new bureau CIO (includes bureau leadership with CJO duties but not title-see definitions). The title and responsibilities of current bureau CIOs <strong><strong>may</strong></strong> be designated or transferred to other agency personnel by the  agency head or his or her designee as appropriate, and such decisions <strong><strong>may</strong></strong> take into consideration recommendation s from the agency CIO.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>N1. CIO role in ongoing bureau CIOs' evaluations. The CHCO and CIO <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> jointly establish an agency-wide critical element (or elements) included in all bureau CIOs' performance evaluations.  In cases where the bureau CIO is a member of the Senior Executive Service and the agency uses the Basic SES Appraisal System, this critical element(s) is an "agency-specific performance requirement " in the Executive Performance Plan. Each such agency <strong>may</strong> determine that critical element(s) (ECQs) contain these requirements. For agencies that do not use the Basic SES Appraisal System or for bureau CIOs who are not members of the SES, then these <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> be critical elements in their evaluations.The [agency] CIO <strong>must</strong> identify "key bureau CIOs" and provide input to the rating official for this critical element(s) for at least all "key bureau CIOs" at the time of the initial summary rating and for any required progress reviews. The rating official <strong>will</strong> consider the input from the [agency] CIO when determining the initial summary rating and discusses it with the bureau CIO during progress reviews. N2. CIO role in ongoing bureau CIOs' evaluations.  The CHCO and CIO <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> jointly establish an agency-wide critical element (or elements) for the evaluation of bureau CIOs as described in N1.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>O1. Bureau IT Leadership Directory. CIO and CHCO <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> conduct a survey of all bureau CIOs and CIO and CHCO <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> jointly publish a dataset identifying all bureau officials with title of CIO or duties of a CIO. This <strong>shall</strong> be posted as a public dataset based on instruction s in the IDC by August 15, 2015 and kept up- to- date thereafter. The report <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> identify for each: Employment type (e.g. GS, SES, SL, ST, etc.) Type of appointment (e.g. career, appointed, etc.) Other responsibilities (e.g. full-time CIO or combination CIO/CFO. Evaluation "rating official" (e.g. bureau head, other official) Evaluation "reviewing official" (if used) Whether [agency) C!O identifies this bureau CIO as a "key bureau CIO" and thus <strong>requires</strong> the [agency] CIO to provide the rating official input into the agency-wide critical element(s) described in N1. O2. Bureau IT Leadership Directory. CHCO <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> work with CIO to develop the Bureau IT Leadership Directory as described in OI .</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>P1. IT Workforce. The CIO and CHCO <strong>will</strong>  develop a set of competency requirements for IT staff, including IT leadership positions, and develop and maintain a current workforce planning process to ensure the department/agency can (a) anticipate and respond to changing mission requirements, (b) maintain workforce skills in a rapidly developing IT environment , and (c) recruit and retain the IT talent needed to accomplish the mission . P2. IT Workforce. CIO and CHCO-- and CAO where relevant-- <strong>shall</strong> develop a set of competency requirements for IT staff, including IT leadership positions, and develop and maintain a current workforce planning process to ensure the department/agency can (a) anticipate and respond to changing mission requirements, (b) maintain workforce skills in a rapidly developing IT environment, and (c) recruit and retain the IT talent needed to accomplish the mission.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Q1. CIO reports to agency  head  (or deputy/COO). As required  by  the <a href="#not-implemented">Clinger Cohen Act</a> and left in place by FITARA, the CIO "<strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> report directly to such agency head to carry out the responsibilities of the agency under this subchapter."This provision  remains unchanged, though certain agencies have since implemented legislation  under which the CIO and other management officials report to a COO, Undersecretary for Management, Assistant Secretary for Administration, or similar management executive ; in these cases, to remain consistent with the Clinger Cohen requirement as left unchanged by FITARA, the CIO <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> have direct access to the agency head (i.e., the Secretary, or Deputy Secretary serving on the Secretary's behalf) regarding programs that include information technology .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>CIO assignment plan</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It <strong>is critical</strong> that the agency CIO retain accountability for the roles and responsibilities identified in the Common Baseline.  As agency environments vary considerably, CIOs <strong>may</strong> find that decisions about some IT resources included in the Common Baseline <strong>may</strong> be more appropriately executed by other agency officials, such as a bureau CIO or even parts of program or procurement communities.  This <strong>must</strong> be done in a way to allow the agency CIO to retain accountability.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies which plan to use such a rules-based method <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> describe it in a "CIO Assignment Plan" (Plan) and submit it for OMB approval as detailed in Section B above [ref. Req. 81.53].  Plans <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> show evidence that the CIO retains accountability for the designated alternative agency officials' involvement and decisions and that the appropriate level of rigor <strong>shall</strong> be executed by this official in place of the CIO.  The agency <strong>shall</strong> post the Plan publicly at agency.gov/digitalstrategy  and include it as a downloadable dataset in the agency's Public Data Listing not more than 30 days following the Plan's approval by OMB.</p>

<p class='context'>Attachment D: Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 PortfolioStat</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>PortfolioStat was established in FY 2012 to assess the maturity of Federal IT portfolio management, consolidate and eliminate duplicative spending on Commodity IT, 26 and improve agency processes to drive mission and customer-focused IT solutions. PortfolioStat is an evidence-based, data-driven review of agency IT portfolio management with agency leadership that continues to drive significant cost savings and efficiencies. To date, agencies have saved over $2.59 billion, 27 exceeding the $2.5 billion in savings opportunities identified in the original FY 2012 PortfolioStat sessions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each year this [PortfoilioStat] process <strong>has</strong> evolved to better align Federal IT policy goals to agency IT portfolios. As part of this evolution, starting in FY 2015 we have changed PortfolioStat from being an annual review session to quarterly reviews.  OMB now collects agency progress data on a quarterly basis and as such <strong>has</strong> an obligation to provide timely performance feedback throughout the year.  Sharing this feedback quarterly will better allow OMB to track progress and recommend course corrections more frequently.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In alignment with the Administration�s core IT objectives, PortfolioStat sessions <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> focus on three key areas: (1) driving value in Federal IT investments, (2) delivering world-class digital services, and (3) protecting Federal IT assets and information.  Prior to each quarterly PortfolioStat session, agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> be provided a scorecard including agency-specific performance metric data (see Fiscal Year 2015 PortfolioStat Performance Metrics below for specific metrics) and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1</p>

<ul>

</li>

<li>
<p>[The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> focus on the following initiatives:] Commodity IT.  Agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> discuss how they use category management to consolidate commodity IT assets, eliminate duplication between assets, and improve procurement and management of hardware, software, network, and telecom services.  Furthermore, agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> share lessons-learned related to commodity IT procurement policies and efforts to establish enterprise-wide inventories of related information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> focus on the following initiatives:] IT Management Roles and Responsibilities. Agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> discuss the status of their plans to implement the Common Baseline (Attachment A) and monitor the effectiveness of the CIO�s execution of the included roles and responsibilities. This <strong>should</strong> include discussion of the CIO�s relationship with other Senior Agency Officials, as well as those officials� execution of listed roles and responsibilities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies <strong>will</strong> focus on the following initiatives:] Portfolio Management Maturity. Agencies <strong>will</strong> use the categories described in Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework to evaluate the maturity of the agency�s People, Technology, Governance, Process, and Acquisition capabilities related to IT resources.  Agencies <strong><strong><strong>should</strong></strong></strong> describe how their policies implement the portfolio management, capital planning, and other processes required in OMB Circular A-130, OMB Circular A-11�s capital planning and investment control guidance, and other OMB IT management policies, including this guidance. For example, agencies <strong><strong><strong>should</strong></strong></strong> describe how agency priority goals, agency strategic objectives, the IT investment portfolio, the Information Resource Management (IRM) Strategic Plan, and the Enterprise Roadmap relate to each other and support the efficient and effective accomplishment of agency program and business objectives. Finally, agencies <strong><strong><strong>should</strong></strong></strong> describe how they select the system development lifecycle frameworks used in IT development activities, such as the use of incremental development and modular approaches prioritized by customer requirements.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>[The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies will focus on the following initiatives:] World-Class Customer Service. Agencies <strong>shall</strong> discuss how their portfolio management practices emphasize the customer-centric themes of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook, OMB�s capital planning and investment control guidance, and the Smarter IT Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal. Agencies <strong>should</strong> describe where in their policies the following are implemented: the Playbook�s �Understand what people need� play, the capital planning guidance requirement for major investments to measure customer satisfaction performance metrics, and the Smarter IT CAP Goal�s focus on improving outcomes and customer satisfaction with Federal services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies will focus on the following initiatives:] Open Data.  Experts have calculated that the potential economic benefits of open data are in the trillions of dollars. The Federal government has made significant strides in opening up data to drive economic growth. Currently there are over 117,000 data sets available on  data.gov.  As a next step, agencies <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> improve the quality and types of datasets. Agencies <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> continue to evaluate their enterprise data inventory, conduct outreach to understand the users of their data, improve customer feedback mechanisms, and release datasets�subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Quarterly PortfolioStat activities <strong>will</strong> take place in three phases: (1) Preparation; (2) Session; and (3) Post-Session. The following [ref. Reqs. 81.77 - 81.79] provides details on each phase with guidance on the schedule and requirements to ensure PortfolioStat is consistently implemented.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Phase 1 [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Preparation.  Following each quarterly agency IDC submission, OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> analyze the latest data, consider trends in performance metrics over time, and review past PortfolioStat topics and PortfolioStat action items to identify topics for the upcoming PortfolioStat session�s discussion.  OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> send these topics, analysis, and proposed agenda for each agency to the agency�s PortfolioStat lead.  Agencies <strong>are encouraged</strong> to work closely with OMB to provide clarifications and improvements to the preparation prior to the quarterly PortfolioStat session.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Phase 2  [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Session. Agency PortfolioStat leads <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> work with OMB to schedule a PortfolioStat session to be held within eight weeks following the relevant IDC quarter�s submission deadline.  In the session, OMB and the agency CIO <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> review updates to the agency's Strategic IRM Plan and Enterprise Roadmap, trending data from the agency�s IDC and IT Dashboard submissions, discuss preceding quarterly PortfolioStat action items, status of investments included in High Impact Program(s), and select performance metrics. Based on the discussion, OMB and the agency <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> identify and agree on PortfolioStat action items (with specific deadlines) which OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> send to the agency within two weeks of the completed session. Where appropriate, results from these sessions <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> be integrated into agency budget submissions and Congressional Budget Justifications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Phase 3  [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Post-Session. Upon receipt of PortfolioStat action items, agency PortfolioStat leads <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> work with OMB to include updates on the status of these items in the next quarterly PortfolioStat.  Agencies that do not meet a deadline identified in a PortfolioStat action item <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> brief the Federal CIO and the agency head at least once per quarter until the action item is complete. Agencies <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> describe progress implementing each PortfolioStat action item as a part of quarterly IDC reporting. At least once per year, agency heads <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> review with the agency CIO and certify that the reported status of each PortfolioStat action item is accurate and send this certification to OMB.</p>
