<p>What <strong>must</strong> agencies do and by when ; 11/15/05 ;  <br />� Assign an official to lead and coordinate agency planning, <br />� Complete an inventory of existing routers, switches, and hardware firewalls (see Attachment A for details);Begin an inventory of all other existing IP compliant devices and technologies not captured in the first inventory (see Attachment A for details); and <br />� Begin impact analysis to determine fiscal and operational impacts and risks of migrating to IPv6 (see Attachment B for details).</p>

<p>What <strong>must</strong> agencies do and by when ; February 2006 ; <br />� Using the guidance issued by Chief Information Officers Council Architecture and Infrastructure Committee (see below), address each of the elements in Attachment C in your agency�s IPv6 transition plan and provide the completed IPv6 transition plan as part of the agency�s Enterprise Architecture (EA) submission to OMB. Additional guidance on your agency�s EA submission will be forthcoming. <br />� Provide a progress report on the inventory and impact analysis, as part of the agency�s Enterprise Architecture (EA) submission to OMB. Additional guidance on your agency�s EA submission will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>What <strong>must</strong> agencies do and by when ; June 30, 2008 ; <br />All agency infrastructures (network backbones) <strong>must</strong> be using IPv6 and agency networks <strong>must</strong> interface with this infrastructure. Agencies will include progress reports on meeting this target date as part of their EA transition strategy.</p>

<p class='context'>Selecting Products and Capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid unnecessary costs in the future, you <strong>should</strong>, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that all new IT procurements are IPv6 compliant. Any exceptions to the use of IPv6 require the agency's CIO to give advance, written approval. An IPv6 compliant product or system must be able to receive, process, and transmit or forward (as appropriate) IPv6 packets and <strong>should</strong> interoperate with other systems and protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6 modes of operation. Specifically, any new IP product or system developed, acquired, or produced must: <br />� Interoperate with both IPv6 and IPv4 systems and products, <br />� If not initially compliant, provide a migration path and commitment to upgrade to IPv6 for all application and product features by June 2008, and <br />� Have available contractor/vendor IPv6 technical support for development and implementation and fielded product management. <br /><br />The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) will develop, as necessary, a standard to address IPv6 compliance for the Federal government. Additionally, as necessary, the General Services Administration and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council will develop a suitable FAR amendment for use by all agencies.</p>
