<p class='context'>Executive Summary</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>The national dialogue on cybersecurity must begin today.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> initiate a national public awareness and education campaign informed by previous successful campaigns. Further, similar to the period after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October, 1957, the United States is in a global race that depends on mathematics and science skills. While we continue to boast the most positive environment for information technology firms in the world, the Nation <strong>should</strong> develop a workforce of U.S. citizens necessary to compete on a global level and sustain that position of leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the next-generation infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the next-generation infrastructure. The United States <strong>should</strong> harness the full benefits of technology to address national economic needs and national security requirements. Federal policy <strong>should</strong> address requirements for national security, protection of intellectual property, and the availability and continuity of infrastructure, even when it is under attack by sophisticated adversaries. The Federal government through partnerships with the private sector and academia needs to articulate coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives. The government, working with State and local partners, <strong>should</strong> identify procurement strategies that will incentivize the market to make more secure products and services available to the public. Additional incentive mechanisms that the government <strong>should</strong> explore include adjustments to liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>I. Leading from the Top</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Anchor Leadership at the White House</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President <strong>should</strong> consider appointing a cybersecurity policy official at the White House, reporting to the NSC [National Security Council] and dual-hatted with the NEC [National Economic Council], to coordinate the Nation�s cybersecurity-related policies and activities. This individual <strong>would</strong> chair the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] and lead a strong process in consultation with other elements of the EOP to resolve competing priorities and coordinate interagency development of policies and strategies for cybersecurity. The cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> participate in all appropriate economic, counterterrorism, and science and technology policy discussions to inform them of cybersecurity perspectives.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To be successful, the President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>must</strong> have clear presidential support, authority, and sufficient resources to operate effectively in policy formulation and the coordination of interagency cybersecurity-related activities. The cybersecurity policy official should be supported by at least two Senior Directors and appropriate staff from the NSC [National Security Council] and at least one Senior Director and appropriate staff from the NEC [National Economic Council]. These directorates <strong>would</strong> report through the cybersecurity policy official and work together in pursuit of the goals set forth in this paper and established as national policy. In addition, to achieve additional scale and integration across the NSC, each NSC  regional and functional directorate should designate an individual to be responsible for following cybersecurity-related issues in the directorate�s portfolio and coordinating with the directorate for cybersecurity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official <strong><strong>should</strong> not</strong> have operational responsibility or authority, nor the authority to make policy unilaterally. Using interagency coordination processes, the cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> harmonize cybersecurity-related policy and technology efforts across the Federal government, ensure that the President�s budget reflects federal priorities for cybersecurity, and develop a legislative agenda, all in consultation with the Federal government�s Chief Technology Officer and Chief Information Officer�along with the appropriate entities within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the NEC [National Economic Council].</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To facilitate coordination, all federal departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> establish a point-of-contact in their respective executive suites authorized to interface with the White House on cybersecurity related issues.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official�through the interagency policy development process�<strong>should</strong> prepare for the President�s consideration an updated national strategy to secure the information and communications infrastructure. The strategy <strong>should</strong> include continued evaluation of CNCI activities and build, where appropriate, on its successes. The national strategy <strong>should</strong> focus senior leadership attention and time toward resolving issues that hamper U.S. efforts to achieve an assured, reliable, secure, and resilient global information and communications infrastructure and related capabilities. The strategy <strong>would</strong> assist government efforts to raise public awareness, renew and build international alliances and public-private partnerships, establish a more comprehensive national cyber response and recovery plan, and promote an aggressive research and development agenda that has the potential to result in new technologies that will enhance cybersecurity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue the principle of �mission bridging� started under the CNCI. Departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> expand the sharing of expertise, knowledge, and perspectives about threats, tradecraft, technology, and vulnerabilities between network defenders and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement organizations that develop U.S. operational capabilities in cyberspace.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] the cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> help coordinate intelligence and military policies and strategies for cyberspace�including for countering terrorist use of the Internet�to ensure integration of all mission equities. The cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> engage external advisory bodies. Many advisory bodies touch on cybersecurity-related issues, including the National Security and Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC), and the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB). The cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> review the responsibilities of these bodies and propose changes as necessary to optimize advice and eliminate unnecessary duplication.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] the cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, <strong>will need to</strong> ensure effective implementation of cybersecurity-related policy and activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, <strong>should</strong> develop structural options to perform appropriate oversight, implementation, and other functions. These could include among others, developing a JIACTF-like function in OMB or elsewhere in the EOP, creating an entity similar to President Eisenhower�s Operations Coordinating Board, or establishing some other entity that, among other things, assists in assessing department and agency performance and oversees federal compliance with cybersecurity standards. Unless and until such an office is established, the work of the JIACTF [Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force] <strong>should</strong> continue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Review Laws and Policies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with departments and agencies to recommend coherent unified policy guidance where necessary in order to clarify authorities, roles, and responsibilities for cybersecurity-related activities across the Federal government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Administration <strong>should</strong> partner appropriately with Congress to ensure adequate law, policies, and resources are available to support the U.S. cybersecurity-related missions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, <strong>should</strong> consult with industry to understand the impact of laws and policies on business operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Strengthen Federal Leadership and Accountability for Cybersecurity.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadership and accountability <strong>must</strong> extend throughout the Federal government. Including cybersecurity among the President�s management priorities and assessing the progress of departments and agencies against stated goals <strong>would</strong> provide additional means to ensure accountability and progress. The cybersecurity policy official�in consultation with NSC [National Security Council], OMB, NEC [National Economic Council], and OSTP�<strong>would</strong> define the milestones and success criteria and raise the visibility of cybersecurity within all agency budgets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To bring transparency and effective management to the overall portfolio for cybersecurity, OMB <strong>should</strong> use its program assessment framework to ensure departments and agencies use performance-based budgeting in pursuing cybersecurity-related goals. A formal program assessment framework for cybersecurity <strong>would</strong> have departments and agencies define each program�s purpose and goal as well as identify metrics to evaluate whether goals are achieved. The CNCI [Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative] has used a variation on this approach successfully.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Department and agency leaders <strong>must</strong> be held accountable, as required by the Federal Information Security Management Act (<a href="#not-implemented">FISMA</a>) of 2002. The Administration <strong>should</strong> work with Congress to update and strengthen this legislation. Performance plans of the department and agency leadership <strong>should</strong> include reporting on progress made to secure systems by each department and agency. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> develop options to hold department and agency leadership accountable for compliance with cybersecurity policies and to enforce implementation of appropriate cybersecurity procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Elevate State, Local, and Tribal Leadership.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>State, local, and tribal governments <strong>should</strong> consider the need to elevate cybersecurity as an issue by designating a single leader to ensure effective coordination between Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), and State Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs). The review team heard from representatives of the National Governors Association that cybersecurity is the weakest link in their efforts to protect critical infrastructure assets in their individual states. HSAs can spend funds under a number of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant programs for cybersecurity efforts, but historically grant funds to a large extent have not been prioritized for cybersecurity. State, local, and tribal governments <strong>should</strong> consider whether to elevate cybersecurity as an issue and <strong>should</strong> ensure that CIOs, CISOs, and HSAs coordinate to achieve a robust defensive posture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>II. Building Capacity for a Digital Nation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The United States <strong>should</strong> initiate a K-12 cybersecurity education program for digital safety, ethics, and security; expand university curricula; and set the conditions to create a competent workforce for the digital age. To help Achieve these goals, the Nation <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Promote cybersecurity risk awareness for all citizens;<br />� Build an education system that will enhance understanding of cybersecurity and allow the United States to retain and expand upon its scientific, engineering, and market leadership in information technology;<br />� Expand and train the workforce to protect the Nation�s competitive advantage; and<br />� Help organizations and individuals make smart choices as they manage risk.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Increase Public Awareness</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government, in partnership with educators and industry, <strong>should</strong> conduct a national cybersecurity public awareness and education. The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> lead the development and direct the implementation of this public awareness strategy and <strong>should</strong> seek endorsement by Congress; State, local, and tribal governments; the private sector; and the civil liberties and privacy communities. The strategy <strong>should</strong> involve public education about the threat and how to enhance digital safety, ethics, and security. This campaign <strong>should</strong> focus on public messages to promote responsible use of the Internet and awareness of fraud, identity theft, cyber predators, and cyber ethics. Past successful public safety campaigns such as Smokey Bear on fire safety and the Click It or Ticket campaign for seat belt safety could be used as a model to inform and persuade the public about the importance of cybersecurity. These public service campaigns <strong>should</strong> focus on making cybersecurity popular for children and for older students choosing careers. Celebrities, the generation that has grown up with the technology, and new types of media can play critical roles in delivering the message effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Increase Cybersecurity Education</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government, with the participation of all departments and agencies, <strong>should</strong> expand support for key education programs and research and development to ensure the Nation�s continued ability to compete in the information age economy. Existing programs <strong>should</strong> be evaluated and possibly expanded, and other activities could serve as models for additional programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Expand Federal Information Technology Workforce</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, in coordination with the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], <strong>should</strong> consider how to better attract cybersecurity expertise and to increase retention of employees with such expertise within the federal service.  Departments and agencies have had success attracting new employees from industry, but the time required to obtain, transfer, or renew security clearances leads to lost opportunities. Federal employees <strong>need to</strong> be able to build portfolios and advance careers in ways they might not be able to do within a single agency. Shared training and rotational assignments across agencies and potentially with the private sector would not only be efficient, but would promote beneficial cross-fertilization and the building of professional networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Promote Cybersecurity as an Enterprise Leadership Responsibility</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue to facilitate programs and information sharing on threats, vulnerabilities, and effective practices across all levels of government and industry. It is not enough for the information technology workforce to understand the importance of cybersecurity; leaders at all levels of government and industry need to be able to make business and investment decisions based on knowledge of risks and potential impacts. State, local, and tribal governments face similar issues. State governments often serve as incubators for innovation and thus may be able to provide lessons learned in managing information and communications infrastructure. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue to work with industry to identify and disseminate effective practices in secure design and operation of information technology products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>III. Sharing Responsibility for Cybersecurity</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Government and industry leaders�both nationally and internationally�<strong>need to</strong> delineate roles and responsibilities, integrate capabilities, and take ownership of the problem to develop holistic solutions. Only through such partnerships will the United States be able to enhance cybersecurity and reap the full benefits of the digital revolution. The global challenge of securing cyberspace requires an increased effort in multilateral forums. This effort <strong>should</strong> seek�in continued collaboration with the private sector�to improve the security of interoperable networks through the development of global standards, expand the legal system�s capacity to combat cyber crime, continue to develop and promote best practices, and maintain stable and effective Internet governance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Improve Partnership Between Private Sector and Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with relevant departments and agencies and the private sector to examine existing public-private partnership and information sharing mechanisms to identify or build upon the most effective models. [Footnote:] These include organizations such as the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) and its constituent bodies such as the Enduring Security Framework, the Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) and Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs); the Federal Bureau of Investigation�s InfraGard; the U.S. Secret Service�s Electronic Crimes Task Forces; the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC); the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC); the Homeland Security Advisory Council; and the associated subcommittees and working groups.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> streamline, align, and provide resources to existing organizations to optimize their capacity to identify priorities, enable more efficient execution, and develop response and recovery plans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Evaluate Potential Barriers Impeding Evolution of Public-Private Partnership</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the partnership [between Public and Private], government <strong>should</strong> work creatively and collaboratively with the private sector to identify tailored solutions that take into account both the need to exchange information and protect public and private interests and take an integrated approach to national and economic security. These solutions <strong>should</strong> identify clear, actionable objectives for the sharing of data and define standards for incident reporting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>could</strong> also consider ways in which it <strong>could</strong> focus more resources on research into possible �game-changing� areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based cybersecurity solutions. The Federal government <strong>could</strong> also consider ways in which it <strong>could</strong> focus more resources on research into possible �game-changing� areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based cybersecurity solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Partner Effectively With the International Community</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong>, working with departments and agencies, strengthen and integrate interagency processes to formulate and coordinate international cybersecurity-related positions. In addition, the Federal government�continuing the long-term history of collaboration with the private sector�<strong>should</strong> develop a proactive engagement plan for use with international standards bodies. This <strong>would</strong> include taking stock of current policies and coordinating the development, refinement, or reaffirmation of positions to ensure that the full range of cybersecurity-related economic, national security, public safety, and privacy interests are taken into account.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with departments and agencies to enhance the identification, tracking, and prioritization of international venues, negotiations, and discussions where cybersecurity-related agreements, standards, activities, and policies are being developed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Working with the private sector, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> coordinate and expand international partnerships to address the full range of cybersecurity-related activities, policies, and opportunities associated with the information and communications infrastructure upon which U.S. businesses, government services, the U.S. military, and nations depend. New agreements between governments and industry may need to be documented to enable international information sharing as well as strategic and operational collaboration. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> increase resources and attention dedicated to conducting outreach and building foreign capacity. For example, the United States <strong>should</strong> accelerate efforts to help other countries build legal frameworks and capacity to fight cybercrime and continue efforts to promote cybersecurity practices and standards. The United States also <strong>should</strong> work with allies to ensure the stability and global interoperability of the Internet, while increasing security and reliability for all users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>IV. creating Effective information Sharing and incident response</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Federal, State, local, and tribal governments <strong>should</strong> work with industry to improve the plans and resources they have in place in advance to detect, prevent, and respond to significant cybersecurity incidents.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Build a Framework for Incident Response</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> be the White House action officer for cyber incident response (a similar role to the action officers who help the White House monitor terrorist attacks or natural disasters).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> have a clear and authoritative cyber incident response framework that needs to be documented in a revised Cyber Incident Annex for the National Response Framework.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] process <strong>should</strong> define roles, responsibilities, and resources for different departments and agencies with respect to incident response - harmonized or enhanced as necessary - recognizing the different aspects of incident response and the different strengths various communities�network security, law enforcement, intelligence, and military�bring to the table.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government - in collaboration with State, local, and tribal governments and industry - <strong>should</strong> develop a set of threat scenarios and metrics that all can use for risk management decisions, recovery planning, and prioritization of R&D. Modeling and simulation capabilities <strong>should</strong> be developed to help exercise these plans and determine potential levels of damage.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] <strong>should</strong> develop clear, enforceable rules for timely reporting of incidents by departments and agencies to enable an effective and efficient interagency response.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, working with the ICI-IPC, <strong>should</strong> determine the most efficient and effective method of developing and maintaining situational awareness and incident response capabilities. The CNCI effort <strong>should</strong> continue to improve federal network defenses but consider the need for adjustments or additions to implementation plans. In particular, the President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Work with the private sector to explore how best to apply technical capabilities to the defense of the national infrastructure and what legal framework would be required to ensure the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties.<br />� Review the operational concept and the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Center (NCSC) to determine whether its proposed responsibilities, resource strategy, and governance are adequate to enable it to provide the shared situational awareness necessary to support cyber incident response efforts<br />� Continue to pursue the goal of the Trusted Internet Connection program to reduce the number of government network connections to the Internet but reconsider goals and timelines based on a realistic assessment of the challenges. Some departments and agencies during the past two years made progress reducing the number of connections and beginning the deployment of systems that will help the Federal government prevent as well as detect malicious behavior. The government, however, still has considerable work to do before full capability is achieved and may need to consider additional policies to enable full implementation of the strategy<br />� Evaluate and continue, as appropriate - in ongoing consultation with the civil liberties and privacy community - pilot deployments of intrusion detection and prevention systems for the benefit of federal networks, evaluate the performance of these systems, and continue studies of the issues that would arise if such capabilities were used with State government systems. These sensors will be vital to gaining situational awareness for federal networks, and the government will benefit from any policy, legal, or technology lessons learned as these deployments move forward.<br />� Explore - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy community - additional, long-term architectures for intrusion detection and prevention systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> improve its ability to provide strategic warning of cyber intrusions and attacks to the President. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue to leverage the Nation�s long-term investments in the fundamental development of cryptologic and information assurance technologies and the necessary supporting infrastructure. These investments, along with other intelligence capabilities, are critical to national strategic warning for attacks through cyberspace. In addition, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> identify any gaps in law enforcement capacity or investigative authority needed to defend the Nation�s infrastructure. Any new authorities would need to be consistent with the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The U.S. Government <strong>should</strong> invest in processes, technologies, and infrastructure that will help prevent cyber incidents. Options include increased security testing, investment in systems that automate or centralize network management, and more restricted connectivity to the Internet for some unclassified systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> consider whether available alternative or reserve communications would be adequate in the event of a major disruption of information and communications infrastructure, particularly as information and communications networks converge. Replacement or repair of infrastructure may also require additional planning and resources, particularly in the event of physical damage to networks or hard-to-replace components of the power grid.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> develop processes between all levels of government and the private sector to assist in preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber incidents by leveraging existing resources. To help build situational awareness related to the information and communications infrastructure, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> leverage existing resources such as the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the 58 State and local Fusion Centers that have been set up around the country.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Enhance Information Sharing To Improve Incident Response Capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector�including data owners, network operators, and experts on privacy and civil liberties�to develop options for cybersecurity-related information sharing that address concerns with privacy and proprietary information and make information sharing mutually beneficial in the national interest. Private companies <strong>are</strong> concerned about the potential uses of their information. The government <strong>must</strong> protect privacy rights, law enforcement equities, intelligence sources and methods, and government information that would provide unfair competitive advantages. Clarity and accountability for both government and the private sector <strong>are</strong> needed to address these concerns. Possible options include:<br />� Creation of a not-for-profit non-governmental organization to serve as a trusted third-party host where government and private sector information may be shared to enhance the security of critical government and private-sector networks. Such an organization could leverage commercial services without disrupting the growing security service market.<br />� Continued engagement between the Federal government (e.g., law enforcement agencies) and individual firms or groups of firms�possibly with the participation of State, local, and tribal governments�that could achieve a level of voluntary information sharing within a particular sector or region beyond what could be achieved in a broader setting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Administration <strong>should</strong> consider, in consultation with affected parties and Congress, developing tailored incentives for information sharing. These measures might include, as a last resort, regulatory measures as part of an integrated approach to satisfying society�s interests in robust and resilient critical infrastructures, civil liberties and privacy protections, and maintaining the fair and open economic markets that underlie the U.S. economic system. Privacy enhancing technologies such as encryption or controlled access authentication could ameliorate some risks in sharing information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> undertake a comprehensive review of policies (such as security classification and clearance requirements) that inhibit interagency sharing of cybersecurity information, seek improvements in information sharing, and <strong>ensure</strong> that they preserve civil liberties and privacy rights and appropriate protection for sensitive information. This review <strong>should</strong> take into account the progress that the Federal government has made through the Security and Suitability Reform Initiative and the Information Sharing Environment effort in examining all facets of the security and suitability processing components.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with the private sector to develop standards for incident reporting by private-sector network operators to the Federal government. Industry has expressed concerns about reporting cyber incidents to which they have fallen victim, including the potential for negative impacts from resulting shareholder concerns, market reactions, or regulatory action. One industry group has proposed a government-industry working group to define sector-specific cyber incident thresholds that warrant reporting to security officials. Use of such information by the government would require rules and oversight, particularly for the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties. Another way to increase reporting is through consideration of appropriate data breach notification laws that require notification to the public and to the government, including law enforcement entities that could pursue investigations. The Federal government also <strong>should</strong> examine the effectiveness and scope of existing reporting requirements for regulated markets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>needs to</strong> define processes and rules for sharing its incident reporting with the private sector. Formulation of these rules <strong>should</strong> consider classification and privacy issues. In addition, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> help the research community gain access, with appropriate controls, to cybersecurity - related event data that could be used to develop tools, test theories, and develop workable solutions. Such sharing <strong>would</strong> need to address the protection of sensitive or proprietary data and personal identity information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> explore expanded sharing of information about network incidents and vulnerabilities with major allies, seeking bilateral or multilateral arrangements that improve cybersecurity consistent with the protection of other U.S. economic and security interests and the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Improve Cybersecurity Across All Infrastructures</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with the private sector to define public-private partnership roles and responsibilities for the defense of privately owned critical infrastructure and key resources.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> consider options for incentivizing collective action and enhance competition in the development of cybersecurity solutions. For example, the legal concepts for �standard of care� to date do not exist for cyberspace. Possible incentives include adjustments to liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with all levels of government, the private sector, and our international partners to develop strategies and plans to encourage the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions and ensure the security and resilience of infrastructure systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>V. Encouraging Innovation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>The Future</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government, the private sector, and other stakeholders together <strong>should</strong> define technology-neutral performance and security objectives for future infrastructure, both to meet its own requirements as a consumer as well as in its capacity as a steward of the public interest. The Federal government and its partners <strong>should</strong> create a family of coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives, customized by sectors and organizations. These objectives could consider different models of computing platforms or network control concepts, and the emergence of technology solutions from government, academic, or industry research programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Link R&D Frameworks to Infrastructure Development</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Under the leadership of the President�s cybersecurity policy official, in collaboration with other EOP entities and the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], the Federal government <strong>should</strong> provide a framework for research and development strategies that focus on game-changing technologies that will help meet infrastructure objectives, building on the existing Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) strategies and other R&D-related work. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> greatly expand coordination of these strategies with industry and academic research efforts to avoid duplication, leverage and synchronize complementary capabilities and agendas, and ensure that technology transitions and enters into the marketplace.<br />� To enhance U.S. competitiveness, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with industry to develop migration paths and incentives for the rapid adoption of research and technology development, including encouragement of collaboration between academic and industrial laboratories.<br />� The Federal government, in collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders, also <strong>should</strong> use the infrastructure objectives and the R&D framework to help define goals for national and international standards bodies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Establish Identity Management as an Option</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy communities - <strong>should</strong> build a cybersecurity-based identity management vision and strategy for the Nation that considers an array of approaches, including privacy-enhancing technologies. The Federal government must interact with citizens through myriad information, services, and benefit programs and thus has an interest in the protection of the public�s private information as well. Increased use of on-line transactions involving financial, health, and commerce require a basis for building trust between the parties to a transaction.<br />� The Nation <strong>should</strong> implement, for high-value activities (e.g., the Smart Grid), an opt-in array of interoperable identity management systems to build trust for online transactions and to enhance privacy.<br />� The National Science and Technology Council�s (NSTC�s) Subcommittee on Biometrics and Identity Management in 2008 published a report that provides a vision for future federal identity management and a series of research and development recommendations. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> use this report as a starting point for identity management strategies.<br />� The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with international partners to develop policies that encourage the development of a global, trusted eco-system that protects privacy rights and civil liberties and governs appropriate use of law enforcement activities to protect citizens and infrastructures.</p>

<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> ensure resources are available for full federal implementation of <a href="#not-implemented">HSPD-12</a>. The Federal government also <strong>should</strong> consider extending the availability of federal identity management systems to operators of critical infrastructure and to private sector emergency response and repair service providers for use during national emergencies.</p>

<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Define procurement strategies through the General Services Administration, building on work by the National Security Agency for the Department of Defense, for commercial products and services in order to create market incentives for security to be part of hardware and software product designs, new security technologies, and secure managed services;<br />� Expand partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and international partners to maximize the market influence of these procurements;<br />� Work with Congress to identify mechanisms that would enable departments and agencies - under appropriate, limited situations - to incorporate threat information into acquisition decisions; and<br />�Work with industry to provide threat information and identify best practices for managing supply chain and insider risks, both from economic and threat perspectives.</p>

<p class='context'>Maintain National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Develop a coordinated plan for national security and emergency preparedness communications capabilities over next-generation networks, including milestones and funding requirements;<br />� Develop options for additional services the Federal government could acquire or direct investments the government could make in the information and communications infra structure to enhance the survivability of communications during a time of natural disaster, crisis, or conflict;<br />� Coordinate with international partners and standards bodies to support next-generation NS/EP communications capabilities in a globally distributed next-generation environment; and<br />� Ensure that efforts associated with the development of Executive Branch continuity communications architectures and next-generation services programs are adequately staffed and resourced.</p>
