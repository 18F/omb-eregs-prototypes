The security controls <strong>must</strong> include one of the three security control baselines from <a href="#not-implemented">NIST SP 800-53</a> that are associated with the designated categorization (impact levels) of their information systems.  The security control baselines define the set of minimum security controls for a low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact information system and provide a starting point for the tailoring process.</p>

However, this general requirement to test and evaluate the effectiveness of information security and privacy policies, procedures, and practices does not imply that agencies <strong>must</strong> assess every selected and implemented security and privacy control at least annually.  Rather, agencies <strong>must</strong> continuously monitor all implemented security and privacy controls (i.e., system-specific, hybrid, and common controls) with a frequency determined by the agency in accordance with the ISCM and PCM strategies.</p>
</li>

<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security and Privacy Assessments ; These strategies <strong>will</strong> define the specific security and privacy controls selected for assessment during any one-year period (i.e., the annual assessment window) with the understanding that all controls may not be formally assessed every year.  Rotational assessment of security and privacy controls is consistent with the transition to ongoing authorization and assumes the information system has completed an initial authorization where all controls were formally assessed for effectiveness.  As the transition to ongoing authorization progresses and agency ISCM programs mature, agencies must ensure that assessment frequencies are determined in accordance with NIST SP 800-137.</p>

The participating officials are collectively responsible and accountable for the system and the common controls and jointly accept the risks that may adversely impact agency operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.�</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Joint and Leveraged Authorizations ; Agencies choosing a joint authorization approach <strong>should</strong> work together on the planning and the execution of the Risk Management Framework tasks described in NIST SP 800-37 and document their agreement and progress in implementing the tasks.

</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Joint and Leveraged Authorizations ; Leveraged authorizations can be used when an agency chooses to accept some or all of the information in an existing authorization package generated by another agency based on the need to use the same information resources (e.g., information system or services provided by the system).[1]  The leveraging agency reviews the owning agency�s authorization package as the basis for determining risk to the leveraging agency.  The leveraging agency considers risk factors such as the time elapsed since the authorization results were produced, differences in environments of operation (if applicable), the impact of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted, and the overall risk tolerance of the leveraging agency.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Joint and Leveraged Authorizations ; The leveraging agency <strong>may</strong> determine that additional security measures are needed and negotiate with the owning agency to provide such measures.  To the extent that a leveraged authorization includes an information system that creates, collects, uses, processes, stores, maintains, disseminates, discloses, or disposes of PII, leveraging agencies must consult their SAOP.  The SAOP <strong>may</strong> determine that additional measures are required to manage privacy risks prior to leveraging the authorization.</p>
