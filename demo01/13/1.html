<p class='context'>Section 55 - Information Technology Investments</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>55.1 Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> submit information on their respective information technology (IT) investment portfolios, using the required formats, as applicable, as stated in the FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance. This section provides general guidance related to reporting on IT and the templates used to collect that information. Section 25.5 provides electronic links to the definitions and specific reporting instructions and exhibits related to budgeting for investments in IT.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Strengthening IT Portfolio Management is a continued focus and commitment to assess the effectiveness of current IT management practices and to address opportunities to improve management of IT resources. Authoritative data is key to providing the ability of IT and business leaders to have data-driven discussions about cost and value of IT to best support business goals. As a Government, we <strong>will</strong> be exploring the adoption of standardized methodologies for IT costing, geared effectively and consistently (using a data-driven agreed upon framework), communicating the cost of IT, and also attributing that cost to business services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Updates to this section lay a path for additional changes planned:<br />� New standard commodity IT Infrastructure and IT Management investments. This year, two standard investments <strong>are</strong> being introduced: IT Security & Compliance (major) and IT Management (non-major). The intent is to identify additional standard investments, against which all agencies will report, to enable Government-wide comparisons and improved benchmarking metrics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.2 Why must I report on information technology investments?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the budget process, OMB is <strong>required</strong> to develop and oversee a process for IT budgeting and portfolio management, with a detailed focus on all major capital investments, to include �analyzing, tracking, and evaluating the risks, including information security risks, and results of all major capital investments made by an executive agency for information systems�. <a href="#not-implemented">40 U.S.C. � 11302</a>. OMB also is <strong>responsible</strong> for IT Portfolio oversight (<a href="#not-implemented">44 U.S.C. � 3602</a>), i.e. the use of information technologies to enhance access of information and delivery of services; and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation of government operations.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> provide required data on total IT funding using the formats specified in the <a href="#not-implemented">FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance</a>. IT funding information <strong>should</strong> be consistent with the overall agency budget submission (see section 51.19), and your agency�s enterprise architecture (EA), Agency IT Portfolio Summary components, and Major IT Business Case submissions. IT investment costs <strong>must</strong> include funding from all Federal budgetary resources (e.g., direct appropriation, collections, transfers, and unobligated balances).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.3 - What specific guidance applies to FY 2017, and when is the information required?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Submissions <strong>should</strong> be consistent with OMB Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Guidance. The IT Portfolio Summary <strong>is required</strong> to be submitted to OMB the same day in September, or within one week, of your Agency�s current services baseline budget submission. Timing details on the Major Business Cases are outlined in the <a href="#not-implemented">FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Additional updates to the Agency IT Portfolio Summary and Agency Major IT Business Cases <strong>may</strong> be applicable after final budget release in order to reflect changes in funding levels due to enactment of appropriations. Specific instructions and deadlines for submitting updates, corrections, and final submissions of exhibits will be available on the OMB MAX Federal Community.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the <a href="#not-implemented">Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (Pub. L. No. 113�291)</a> and related OMB guidance, Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), and budget officers <strong>must</strong> coordinate to ensure that IT budget data is consistent with the agency�s budget submission, and <strong>must</strong> complete �IT Resources Statements� described in section 51.3.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For IT budget submission, agencies <strong>may</strong> submit fluctuations within IT investments and the IT portfolio between FY 2017 and FY 2018, as long as these fluctuations are coordinated and consistent with the agency�s overall current services baseline. Within the budget process, agencies also <strong>must</strong>:<br />� ensure security of Federal information systems and data, while developing a continuous refresh and modernization process to secure information systems by design;<br />� account for regular software and product lifecycle refreshment;<br />� leverage best practices and lessons learned from other organizations to increase agility and flexibility in technology programs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OMB�s IT Category Management (ITCM) policies, <a href="#not-implemented">M-16-02, Category Management Policy 15-1</a>: Improving Acquisition and Management of Common Information Technology: Laptops and Desktops, and M-16-12 Category Management 16-1: Improving the Acquisition and Management of Common Information Technology: Software Licensing provide explicit guidance and targets for agencies that will impact how they formulate and execute their IT budgets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 3.28] As described in these policies, , agencies are <strong>required</strong> to follow ITCM policies and to ensure that the budgets incorporate the financial benefits as published by OMB. Agency IT budget submissions will be reviewed to ensure they are implementing these policies. Future guidance will include additional ITCM objectives.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The annual E-Gov MAX collection of information on expected agency contributions to E-Government and Line-of-Business initiatives for FY 2018 commenced in June 2016. This data collection for the FY 2018 budget reflects some important changes from prior years, including:]<br />� a requirement that by August 26, 2016, CFOs certify that required contribution levels are being included in the agency�s budget planning to OMB; and � each agency managing or contributing to E-Government and Line-of-Business</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.4 - How should agencies align IT investments with their strategic plans?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An agency�s IT investment management and reporting of IT investments <strong>must</strong> clearly demonstrate that each investment is needed to help meet the agency's strategic goals and mission and show how governance processes are used to plan, select, develop, implement, and operate those IT investments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] each IT investment <strong>should</strong> demonstrate the enabling and improvement of mission and program performance. Agencies demonstrate the IT Investment requirements and governance processes through Agency Major IT Business Cases, supporting documentation, Information Resources Management Strategic Plan, Enterprise Roadmap, and Agency IT Portfolio Summary submissions. The agency <strong>must</strong> further demonstrate how the investment supports a business line or enterprise service performance goal as documented in the agency�s enterprise architecture (EA), and annual Enterprise Roadmap submission to OMB. Documents used to manage the planning, development, implementation, and operation of IT investments and documents that demonstrate the outcomes of agency, branch, and bureau governance decisions <strong>should</strong> be maintained and made readily available if requested by OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency strategic planning <strong>should</strong> incorporate the requirement for regular software and product lifecycle refresh.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The individual agency's Agency IT Portfolio Summary submissions are used to create an overall "Federal IT Portfolio," which is published as part of the President's Budget. Agency and OMB portfolio reviews and Budget processes <strong>will ensure</strong> the selection of IT investments that support the agency�s strategic objectives or performance goals, as captured in the agency�s Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.6 What do I need to know about an agency's IT Budget and Management Requirements?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[The agency�s IT Budget and Management information is composed of two parts: ]<br />1) Agency IT Portfolio Summary � which includes:<br />a. Agency IT Investment Portfolio Summary - Includes IT investment budget, management, and architecture information, and the following Summary information:<br />b. Agency IT Provisioned Services Spending Summary - Includes IT investment budget and management information by cloud computing deployment model and service model;<br />c. Agency Data Center Spending Summary - Includes an Data Center spending summary for data center costs that the agency owns and operates; and<br />d. Budget Account Summary � Includes a summarized view of IT funding levels associated with budget accounts. This summary is derived from the Funding Sources table in the Agency IT Portfolio Summary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The agency�s IT Budget and Management information is composed of two parts: ]<br />2) Major IT Business Case - Includes detailed IT investment budget and management information for major IT investment</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency reporting of its IT Portfolio <strong>should</strong> include all of an agency�s annual IT costs. The agency�s complete IT portfolio <strong>must</strong> be reported, including all major, non-major, migration related, and funding contributions IT investments. For the FY 2018 budget submission, IT funding levels reported in the Agency IT Portfolio Summary <strong>should</strong> be consistent with your agency�s budget materials and <strong>should</strong> be categorized based upon the following four parts: <br />Category:<br />� Part 1 IT Investments for Mission Delivery<br />� Part 2 IT Investments for Administrative Services and Support Systems<br />� Part 3 IT Investments for Commodity IT Infrastructure and IT Management<br />� Part 4 IT Investments for Grants and Other Transferred Funding to Non-Federal Organizations for Information Technology.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Part 2 includes eGov/LoB and Unified Shared Services Management designated shared services. Previously required Part 4: Grants Management <strong>should</strong> be included in Part 2. Part 5: National Security Systems <strong>should</strong> be aligned against the appropriate Part above and will be delineated using investment type identifiers.<br /><br />Per section 51.3, your justification materials <strong>should</strong> include a section beginning with the words "IT Resource Statements" that provides the following: a statement from the CIO affirming that the CIO has reviewed and approved the major IT investments portion of your budget request; a statement from the CFO and CIO affirming that the CIO had a significant role in reviewing planned IT support for major program objectives and significant increases and decreases in IT resources; and a statement from the CIO and CFO that the IT Portfolio includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the budget request. If for any reason any of the above is not accurate, briefly describe the nature of the inaccuracy. The above statements and discussion <strong>must</strong> also be included in your agency's annual assurance statement described in <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-123</a>.</p>
