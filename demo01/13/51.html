L. No. 107-347). Within the operational framework of FedRAMP, DHS activities <strong>will</strong> include: <br />i. Assisting government-wide and agency-specific efforts to provide adequate, risk-based and cost-effective cybersecurity; <br />ii. Coordinating cybersecurity operations and incident response and providing appropriate assistance; <br />iii. Developing continuous monitoring standards for ongoing cybersecurity of Federal information systems to include real-time monitoring and continuously verified operating configurations; <br />iv. Developing guidance on agency implementation of the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program with cloud services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>DOD, DHS, and GSA have agreed to establish a JAB and serve as permanent members of the Board. The JAB <strong>shall</strong>: <br />i. Consist of Chief Information Officers from DOD, DHS, and GSA, supported by designated technical representatives from their respective member organizations; <br />ii. Define and regularly update the FedRAMP security authorization requirements in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) and DHS guidance; <br />iii. Approve accreditation criteria for third-party assessment organizations (3PAOs) to provide independent assessments of CSPs� implementation of the FedRAMP security authorization requirements; <br />iv. Establish and publish priority queue requirements for authorization package reviews; <br />v. Review authorization packages for cloud services based on the priority queue; <br />vi. Grant provisional authorizations for cloud services that can be used as an initial approval that Executive departments and agencies leverage in granting security authorizations and an accompanying authority to operate (ATO) for use; <br />vii. Ensure that provisional authorizations are reviewed and updated regularly and notify Executive departments and agencies of any changes to provisional authorizations including removal of such authorizations; and <br />viii. Establish methods for input to the FedRAMP security authorization requirements from all Executive departments and agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA has agreed to establish a FedRAMP PMO which <strong>will</strong>: <br />i. Create a process for Executive departments and agencies and CSPs to adhere to the FedRAMP security authorization requirements created by the JAB to include, but not limited to: <br />a. A methodology for harmonizing agency-specific security and privacy controls with the FedRAMP security authorization requirements; <br />b. A mechanism for Executive departments and agencies and CSPs to request security authorization initiation through the FedRAMP PMO and JAB; <br />c. Guidance for Executive departments and agencies to satisfy FedRAMP security authorization requirements when a proposed cloud service is not prioritized for review by the FedRAMP PMO and JAB; <br />d. A framework for Executive departments and agencies to leverage security authorization packages processed by FedRAMP; and <br />e. In coordination with DHS, a framework for continuous monitoring, incident response and remediation, and FISMA reporting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA has agreed to establish a FedRAMP PMO which <strong>will</strong> [ref. Reqs. 98.03-98.08]: <br />ii. Prioritize requests for authorization and authorization package review by the JAB in accordance with the JAB-approved priority queue requirements and publish and update on a continuous basis the FedRAMP priority queue;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA has agreed to establish a FedRAMP PMO which <strong>will</strong> [ref. Reqs. 98.03-98.08]:<br />iii. Establish a centralized, secure repository detailing requests for authorization, agency provided authorization packages, CSP-provided authorization packages, and JAB provisional authorization packages of cloud services that Executive departments and agencies can leverage to grant security authorizations;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA has agreed to establish a FedRAMP PMO which <strong>will</strong> [ref. Reqs. 98.03-98.08]:<br />iv. Coordinate and collaborate with the NIST to develop and implement a formal conformity assessment program to accredit 3PAOs to provide independent assessments of how CSPs implement the FedRAMP requirements;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA has agreed to establish a FedRAMP PMO which <strong>will</strong> [ref. Reqs. 98.03-98.08]:<br />v.

</li>

<li>
<p>GSA has agreed to establish a FedRAMP PMO which <strong>will</strong> [ref. Reqs. 98.03-98.08]:<br />vi. Develop and make available to Executive departments and agencies template Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) and/or Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) that <strong>will</strong> govern the exchange of information between Executive departments, agencies and the FedRAMP PMO.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each Executive department or agency <strong>shall</strong>: <br /><br />i. Use FedRAMP when conducting risk assessments, security authorizations, and granting ATOs for all Executive department or agency use of cloud services; <br /><br />ii. Use the FedRAMP PMO process and the JAB-approved FedRAMP security authorization requirements as a baseline when initiating, reviewing, granting and revoking security authorizations for cloud services;10 <br /><br />iii. Ensure applicable contracts appropriately require CSPs to comply with FedRAMP security authorization requirements; <br /><br />iv. Establish and implement an incident response and mitigation capability for security and privacy incidents for cloud services in accordance with DHS guidance; <br /><br />v. Ensure that acquisition requirements address maintaining FedRAMP security authorization requirements and that relevant contract provisions related to contractor reviews and inspections are included for CSPs; <br /><br />vi. Consistent with DHS guidance, require that CSPs route their traffic such that the service meets the requirements of the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program; and <br /><br />vii. Provide to the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) annually on April 30, a certification in writing from the Executive department or agency CIO and Chief Financial Officer, a listing of all cloud services that an agency determines cannot meet the FedRAMP security authorization requirements with appropriate rationale and proposed resolutions.</p>
