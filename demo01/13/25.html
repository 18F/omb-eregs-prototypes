<p class='context'>General Requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Subject to the requirements set forth below, agencies <strong>may</strong> use third-party websites and applications to engage openly with the public. These websites and applications offer new tools that will help people to connect with their government, promoting the goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> also provide individuals with alternatives to third-party websites and applications. People <strong>should</strong> be able to obtain comparable information and services through an agency�s official website or other official means. For example, members of the public <strong>should</strong> be able to learn about the agency�s activities and to communicate with the agency without having to join a third-party social media website. In addition, if an agency uses a third-party service to solicit feedback, the agency <strong>should</strong> provide an alternative government email address where users can also send feedback.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Third-Party Privacy Policies.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Before an agency uses any third-party website or application to engage with the public, the agency <strong>should</strong> examine the third party�s privacy policy to evaluate the risks and determine whether the website or application is appropriate for the agency�s use. In addition, the agency <strong>should</strong> monitor any changes to the third party�s privacy policy and periodically reassess the risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>External Links</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If an agency posts a link that leads to a third-party website or any other location that is not part of an official government domain, the agency <strong>should</strong> provide an alert to the visitor, such as a statement adjacent to the link or a �pop-up,� explaining that visitors are being directed to a nongovernment website that may have different privacy policies from those of the agency�s official website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Embedded Applications</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If an agency incorporates or embeds a third-party application on its website or any other official government domain, the agency <strong>should</strong> take the necessary steps to disclose the third party�s involvement and describe the agency�s activities in its Privacy Policy, as specified in this Memorandum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Branding</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In general, when an agency uses a third-party website or application that is not part of an official government domain, the agency <strong>should</strong> apply appropriate branding to distinguish the agency�s activities from those of nongovernment actors. For example, to the extent practicable, an agency <strong>should</strong> add its seal or emblem to its profile page on a social media website to indicate that it is an official agency presence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Information Collection.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If information is collected through an agency�s use of a third-party website or application, the agency should collect only the information �necessary for the proper performance of agency functions and which has practical utility.� If personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, the agency should collect only the minimum necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation, or executive order</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Requirements for Privacy Assessment and Public Notice.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The PIA <strong>should</strong> describe: i. the specific purpose of the agency�s use of the third-party website or application; ii. any PII that is likely to become available to the agency through public use of the third-party website or application; iii. the agency�s intended or expected use of PII; iv. with whom the agency will share PII ;v. whether and how the agency will maintain PII, and for how long;<br />vi. how the agency will secure PII that it uses or maintains;<br />vii. what other privacy risks exist and how the agency will mitigate those<br />risks; and<br />viii. whether the agency�s activities will create or modify a �system of records�<br />under the Privacy Act.</p>

<p class='context'>Agency Privacy Policies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#not-implemented">OMB Memoranda M-99-1813 and M-03-22</a> establish requirements for agency Privacy Policies.

</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Privacy Notices.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the extent feasible, an agency <strong>should</strong> post a Privacy Notice, described below, on the third-party website or application itself. The Privacy Notice <strong>should</strong>: i. explain that the website or application is not a government website or application, that it is controlled or operated by a third party, and that the agency�s Privacy Policy does not apply to the third party; ii. indicate whether and how the agency will maintain, use, or share PII that becomes available through the use of the third-party website or application; iii. explain that by using the website or application to communicate with the agency, individuals may be providing nongovernment third parties access to PII; iv. direct individuals to the agency�s official website; and v. direct individuals to the agency�s Privacy Policy as described above. An agency <strong>should</strong> take all practical steps to ensure that its Privacy Notice is conspicuous, salient, clearly labeled, written in plain language, and prominently displayed at all locations where the public might make PII available to the agency.</p>
