<p class='context'>Background</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In November 2007, OMB announced the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative to optimize individual agency network services into a common solution for the Federal government. Agencies were required to develop and submit comprehensive Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to reduce and consolidate the number of external access points, including Internet connections; and ensure that all external connections are routed through an OMBapproved TIC. <br /><br />Based on solicited agency Statements of Capability, OMB also designated twenty agencies as TIC Access Providers (TICAPS). Each TICAP agency was authorized two locations where they <strong>must</strong> reduce and consolidate all external connections. Agencies <strong>must</strong> present an evidence-based rationale for acquisition of more than two locations. Please send an email to tic@dhs.gov for the template and instructions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Specific Actions Requested</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> update and report formal Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to the Department of Homeland Security by September 25, 2009, and provide updated status to DHS every six months thereafter, until completed. <br /><br />All agencies seeking Trusted Internet Connection Access Provider (TICAP) services <strong>shall</strong> utilize the template in enclosure (1) and submit it to tic@dhs.gov. For reference by TICAP agencies only, a blank TICAP agency POA&M is provided in enclosure (2). DHS has separately contacted the 20 TICAP agencies with instructions on how to update their POA&Ms. <br /><br />In addition to the POA&M, TICAP agencies must schedule by September 25, 2009 their initial TIC compliance on-site assessments with DHS. All other agencies must also collaborate with DHS to complete their initial TIC compliance self-assessments by December 31, 2009. <br /><br />Federal policy requires all agencies to undertake immediate responsibility for executing essential agreements and updating POA&Ms to facilitate not only TIC preparations, but also due diligence for integrating the National Cyber Protection System (NCPS, operationally referred to as Einstein) deployments and synchronizing with US-CERT.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Specific Actions Requested</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> work with DHS on studies of Federal network infrastructure, and report data from the agencyï¿½s inventory of network connections to DHS as requested. Each agency is responsible for maintaining a current inventory of its network connections, including details on the service provider, cost, capacity and traffic volume for each connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Specific Actions Requested</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies that are seeking service through the Networx contract vehicle <strong>will</strong> work with the General Services Administration (GSA) to estimate costs of adopting the MTIPS option by September 30, 2009. Please contact GSA at (866) 472-0274.</p>
