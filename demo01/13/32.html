<p>Each agency <strong>should</strong> develop and issue an implementation policy through which the agency will require the use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for access to that agency�s facilities, networks, and information systems. Effective immediately, all new systems under development must be enabled to use PIV credentials, in accordance with NIST guidelines, prior to being made operational.</p>

<p>Each agency <strong>should</strong> develop and issue an implementation policy through which the agency will require the use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for access to that agency�s facilities, networks, and information systems.  Effective the beginning of FY2012, existing physical and logical access control systems must be upgraded to use PIV credentials, in accordance with NIST guidelines, prior to the agency using development and technology refresh funds to complete other activities.</p>

<p>Agency processes <strong>must</strong> accept and electronically verify PIV credentials issued by other federal agencies.</p>

<p>Each agency <strong>should</strong> develop and issue an implementation policy through which the agency will require the use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for access to that agency�s facilities, networks, and information systems. <br /><br />The government-wide architecture and completion of agency transition plans must align as described in the Federal CIO Council�s �Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Roadmap and Implementation Guidance� (available at www.idmanagement.gov).</p>
