<p>In order to assure effective management for IT and minimize any disruption during the upcoming transition or any transition of leadership, please review the attached IT governance framework and summarize your agency�s current alignment with each element of the framework via signed memorandum by December 1, 2008. This summary may also include information on activities currently underway or other related management plans. OMB�s Office of EGovernment and Information Technology is here to assist you and your CIO in the implementation of this framework.</p>

<p>In particular, this framework includes the requirement for Heads of Departments and Agencies to consult with the Director of the Office of Management Budget (OMB) prior to appointing an Agency-Appointed CIO, and to advise the Director on matters regarding the authority, responsibilities and organizational resources of the CIO, per OMB Circular A-130 (published November 28, 2000), Section 9, Assignment of Responsibilities. Consultation with OMB on CIO appointments should be factored into your agency�s selection process, and OMB will ensure its input into such selections is expeditious.</p>
