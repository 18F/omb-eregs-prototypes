<p>Government <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing. Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset. My Administration <strong>will</strong> take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use. Executive departments and agencies <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> harness new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public.</p>

<p>Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> also solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

<p>Government <strong>should</strong> be participatory. [...] Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information. Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> also solicit public input on how we can increase and improve opportunities for public participation in Government.</p>

<p>Government <strong>should</strong> be collaborative. Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government. Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector. Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> solicit public feedback to assess and improve their level of collaboration and to identify new opportunities for cooperation.</p>

<p>I <strong>direct</strong> the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services, to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies, within 120 days, of recommendations for an Open Government Directive, to be issued by the Director of OMB, that instructs executive departments and agencies to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in this memorandum. The independent agencies <strong>should</strong> comply with the Open Government Directive.</p>
