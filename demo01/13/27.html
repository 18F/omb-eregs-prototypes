<p class='context'>Guiding Principles</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Split projects into smaller, simpler segments with clear deliverables</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Project segments <strong>should</strong> generally take no longer than 90 -120 days to achieve specific project milestones. Although all specific milestones may not deliver functionality, all such milestones must support the delivery of well defined functionality. The overall length of a development project <strong>should</strong> not exceed 24 months. Historically, Federal government IT projects have involved expansive, long-term projects that attempt to change almost every aspect of a business system at once. These projects have taken years, sometimes a decade, and have failed at alarming rates. The best practice in IT project design now focuses on the development of an overall, high-level system architecture with specific development projects working on tight timetables with clear deliverables that provide interim functionality. This approach simplifies planning, development, project management and oversight, and training. It reduces risk and allows changes in technology to be incorporated into later phases at lower costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Focus on most critical business needs first.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Historic practice in Federal IT system projects has been to attempt to address a wide range of needs at once through expansive process reengineering projects. The complexity involved in this approach has added substantially to costs, significantly increased risks and delayed implementation of all functionality, including the most critical needs. One of the benefits of the segmented approach outlined above is that it allows prioritization of needs and functionality. The most critical functionality can be delivered first while functions of lesser importance can be considered for subsequent delivery. Among other benefits, this process has been proven to cause a healthy reevaluation or reconsideration of secondary functions after critical functions are in place and being used. Therefore, revised projects plans <strong>should</strong> prioritize the most critical financial functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Ongoing, transparent project oversight</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the major causes of IT system failure is insufficient oversight by senior management. Often in the Federal government, senior agency managers do not adequately monitor projects on an ongoing basis once they are underway. Proven best practices in this area include identifying up-front a series of milestones, warning flags, and stop points over the course of the segment lifecycle which, if deemed necessary, can cause the project to be suspended and returned to planning. Additionally, clear deliverables <strong>should</strong> be monitored closely and any delays in deliverables <strong>should</strong> automatically result in a more in-depth review of a project. Finally, mechanisms for review of project status by senior management <strong>should</strong> be built into a project plan. Revised agency projects plans <strong>should</strong> integrate these best practices into their oversight processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>OMB Review Process</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Projects Subject to Review</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Projects Subject to Review , all financial system modernization projects with $20 million or more in planned spending on development or modernization expenses shall be halted pending an agency re-evaluation and a subsequent review by OMB as noted below. In addition, as a part of this review, projects identified as high-risk by OMB <strong>should</strong> require more frequent assessment to include review of task orders or activities. Review of projects nearing completion may be abbreviated and will include consideration of the costs and benefits of implementing the policy within the project. Agencies that have previously completed modernization projects must refrain from moving into additional rounds of planning and development until OMB has approved a revised implementation plan for those projects consistent with this guidance. Lastly, OMB may review systems that have completed implementation when a failure occurs (e.g., the system fails in performing basic functions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Financial Systems Advisory Board</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As of this date, OMB is establishing the Financial Systems Advisory Board (Board) under the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Council. The Board <strong>will</strong> include CFOs and CIOs from major agencies and have available experts from various communities, including acquisition and e-government. Its function <strong>will</strong> be to make recommendations to OMB, as requested, on projects being reviewed under this memorandum. Agencies with longstanding expertise in IT project management may also be asked to participate more extensively and directly with OMB in the overall review process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Project Plans</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days of this order, agencies <strong>will</strong> provide revised project plans for all projects covered herein to OMB for review. Such plans, as described in Attachment A, shall clearly outline the project�s strategy for reducing costs, shortening the project timeline, and reducing risks. Criteria for review <strong>will</strong> be the Guiding Principles described earlier in this Memorandum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Project Review</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB <strong>will</strong> review revised project plans within 60 days of submission. This review may include presentation of plans to the Board for its evaluation and recommendations, but OMB <strong>will</strong> make the final decision regarding approval of a revised project plan. Many agencies have already begun working on revised project plans. Attachment B includes an initial schedule of review dates for these projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Funds Execution and Link to Project Reviews</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning in the first quarter of FY 2011, to align with this guidance, financial system investments subject to this guidance <strong>will</strong> be apportioned consistent with a segmented approach. Where the apportionment process is employed, funding shall be controlled under Category B on a quarterly basis. As such, contracts shall reflect the overall implementation phase of 18 to 24 months, with task orders written to reflect 90 to 120-day deliverables. Task orders shall be funded consistent with the apportionment � after OMB review throughout the development, modernization, and execution phases. For projects that OMB has not designated as high-risk or that have a proven track record of achieving specific milestones within well-defined segments, OMB may employ flexibility regarding funds control. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB shall assess whether or not an investment should receive funding for the next segment. If approved, OMB <strong>will</strong> apportion funding for the next segment under Category B. If approval is not granted, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with the affected agency to redirect funding pursuant to existing Congressional reprogramming requirements. An agency�s failure to complete a segment as planned may be a basis for canceling the remaining investment. Additionally, inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate data or documentation may be justification for redirecting funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Future Reviews</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Subsequent to initial project reviews and approval of revised plans, OMB <strong>will</strong> review project status, and as necessary <strong>will</strong> re-engage the Board, on a quarterly basis through FY 2012. These reviews <strong>will</strong> be used, among other things, to inform the appropriations process for FY 2011 and OMB�s review of budget proposals for FY 2012. Funding for projects subject to the apportionment process under this guidance <strong>will</strong> continue to be apportioned on a quarterly basis through Category B allocations. Projects must continue to meet 90 to 120-day milestones in order for OMB to release project funding for additional segments. For projects that have a proven track record of achieving specific milestones within well-defined segments, OMB may employ flexibility regarding funds control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Shared Services, Financial System Standards, and Financial Software Testing and Certification</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Shared Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB supports shared service arrangements when cost effective, but <strong>will</strong> no longer mandate them in all cases for financial management systems. Past attempts to mandate use of financial management shared services yielded inconsistent results, as medium and large agencies encountered the same types of costs and risks with a shared service provider as they did when modernizing �in house.� These risks, along with early reluctance by Federal agencies to fully leverage the shared service model, led agencies to pursue shared service arrangements for low impact areas in terms of operational efficiency, such as common hosting, and to defer higher impact areas, such as common transaction processing. OMB expects the requirements to re-scope agency modernization projects contained in this guidance <strong>will</strong> enable greater adoption of shared service arrangements with lower risk and greater cost impacts. Further, financial management shared service efforts <strong>will</strong> now focus on the higher impact area of transaction processing. OMB, Department of the Treasury, and the CFO Council <strong>will</strong> identify the development of common automated solutions for transaction processing. The Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation, which has been recently established within Treasury�s Fiscal Service, <strong>will</strong> pilot these solutions. The first priorities <strong>will</strong> be to develop initial operating capabilities for vendor invoicing and intergovernmental transactions. Existing shared service relationships <strong>will</strong> remain unchanged, but agencies that are being cross-serviced can re-evaluate whether the current and future relationship remains cost-effective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Financial System Standards.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Current �Core Financial System� requirements remain in effect and Federal agencies have an ongoing responsibility to comply with them. OMB <strong>will</strong> soon issue a revision to OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, which <strong>will</strong> update existing requirements and include new guidance on how agencies and auditors <strong>will</strong> assess compliance with these requirements. Specifically, OMB <strong>will</strong> initiate a performance based approach to assessing compliance that <strong>will</strong> assist in the overall objective to reduce the cost, risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations. The objective of this approach <strong>will</strong> be to provide additional flexibility for Federal agencies to initiate smaller scale financial modernizations as long as relevant financial management outcomes (e.g., clean audits, proper controls, timely reporting) are maintained.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Software Certification</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB is reforming the certification process by shifting the accountability for software performance to the vendor through self-certification. To the extent software functionality does not perform in accordance with vendor certification, the Federal agency <strong>will</strong> hold the vendor accountable in the same manner in which other contractual obligations are enforced, such as through the imposing of liquidated damages, requiring repair or replacement, or terminating the contract. If the contractor is found to have made any materially false or fraudulent statements or representations, it may be subject to penalties under the False Statement Act. This should make contractors clearly accountable for delivering what they promise. OMB <strong>will</strong>, as appropriate, revisit this policy on an annual basis to determine the potential need for refinement. Additional details related to this change to the testing process <strong>will</strong> be provided in an upcoming revision to OMB CircularA-127, scheduled to be issued this summer, as well as the OMB Audit Bulletin.</p>
