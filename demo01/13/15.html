<p class='context'>Clarification regarding SmartBuy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>GSA, under the direction of OMB, is leading and managing the SmartBuy initiative</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The improved SmartBuy initiative <strong>will</strong> focus on achieving short-term, mid-term, and long term results</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>By April 15, 2004, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in conjunction with the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) <strong>will</strong> compile a list of all software acquisitions (by any purchase mechanism including credit cards) during calendar year 2003 by the name and version of the software and prepare a projection of the software acquisitions for calendar year 2004.  <strong>Submit</strong> the lists to OMB and GSA. Start the lists with the ten initial SmartBuy opportunities depicted by market category (see Attachment 1).  For each category, <strong><strong>provide</strong></strong> the name of the software, the number of units purchased, the lowest and highest price paid for the software, the total cost for the year and the average price paid.  For the 2004 projections, <strong><strong>provide</strong></strong> the total units expected to be purchased by category.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA <strong>will</strong> use the information [ref. Req. 44.01] to negotiate software contracts for government-wide use.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />At least thirty days before GSA expects to award a SmartBuy contract for a category of software, GSA <strong>will</strong> notify all agencies they should, to the extent possible, postpone all further purchase requirements until the SmartBuy contract is awarded.  Agencies <strong>may</strong> ask GSA for a waiver for compelling needs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />Upon award of the SmartBuy contract, agencies <strong>must</strong> review the SmartBuy contract to determine whether it satisfies their needs and, absent a compelling justification for doing otherwise, agencies <strong>shall</strong> acquire their software requirements from the SmartBuy contract.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br /> If an agency has contracts for software from the list of ten SmartBuy opportunities, or in the areas of human resources, financial management, and grants, that do not have yearly options, the agency <strong>shall</strong> seek to renegotiate the contracts to include yearly options beginning October 1, 2004, so as to allow for an easy transition to a SmartBuy contract.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />Agencies <strong>may</strong> procure software other than through the SmartBuy contract in situations where a compelling justification exists.  The agency <strong>needs to</strong> prepare a memorandum setting forth the compelling justification, which <strong>needs to</strong> be signed by both the agency�s SPE and CIO.  After approval by the SPE and the CIO, the justification <strong>shall</strong> be sent to GSA with a copy to the OMB E-Government Administrator, at least 30 days prior to the expected award of the affected SmartBuy contract.  The justification <strong>shall</strong> specify why the SPE and the CIO have concluded use of the SmartBuy contract is not in the best interest of the agency, including specific and quantifiable reasons.  GSA, after coordination with the OMB E-Government Administrator, <strong>will</strong> respond to the agency before award of the SmartBuy contract.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />By May 31, 2004, the SmartBuy Program Office <strong>will</strong> announce the federal government intends to pursue a SmartBuy deal in the areas of human resources systems, financial management systems, grant systems, office automation software, and analytical tools by publishing a request for information (RFI).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />By October 1, 2004, the goal is to initiate SmartBuy deals in these human resources systems, financial management systems, grant systems, office automation software, and analytical tools.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When GSA is ready to begin this phase [ref. Req. 44.08], it <strong>will</strong> notify agencies to update their list of past purchases and future projections, and <strong>will</strong> follow the same sequence of events listed above for these categories.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> annually, at the time of the budget submission, send GSA and OMB a listing of all projected software requirements, by category, for the next two fiscal years (for example in September 2004, provide data for FY 2005 and 2006).  GSA <strong>will</strong> request agencies to update their projections when GSA is ready to pursue a new SmartBuy opportunity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA <strong>will</strong> request agencies to update their projections [ref. Req. 44.10] when GSA is ready to pursue a new SmartBuy opportunity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA <strong>will</strong> publish SmartBuy deals in FedBizOpps prior to any negotiations to ensure there is competition and visibility into the procurement process.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Clarification regarding duplication of E-Government Initiatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />Agency CIOs and SPEs <strong>shall</strong> issue instructions by March 15, 2004 on the review of all planned IT acquisitions for potential duplication with the President�s 24 E-Government initiatives.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If a potential duplication is found [ref. Req. 44.13], the CIO <strong>will</strong> contact the managing partner of the initiative and the OMB E-Government Administrator for a recommendation on whether the agency acquisition should proceed or be cancelled by the agency and included in the E-Government Initiative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
