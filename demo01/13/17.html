<p>Overall, the management of agencies' public websites <strong>should</strong> be in compliance with Federal information resource management law and policy.</p>

<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> manage Federal agency public websites as part of their information resource management program following guidance in OMB Circular A-130, OMB �Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies� (67 FR 5365), this memorandum, and other information policy issuances.</p>

<p>OMB expects prompt and orderly implementation of the policies in this memorandum and its attachment.  OMB expects agencies to become fully compliant with new requirements by 12/31/05 and continue to adhere to existing requirements.</p>

<p class='context'>Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>1. Establish and Maintain Information Dissemination Product Inventories, Priorities, and  Schedules</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Your agency is already required under <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-130</a> and the <a href="#not-implemented">Paperwork Reduction Act</a> to disseminate information to the public in a timely, equitable, efficient, and appropriate manner and to maintain inventories of information dissemination products.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. Section 207 of the E-Government Act requires your agency to develop priorities and schedules for making Government information available and accessible to the public, in accordance with public comment, and to post this information on your agency�s website.  Section 207 also requires your agency to report to OMB, as part of the agency�s annual E-Government Act report, the final determinations of inventories, priorities, and schedules your agency has made.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>C. Your agency <strong>must</strong> also post to your agency�s website any updates to your agency�s final determination of inventories, priorities, and schedules, and include this information in your agency�s annual <a href="#not-implemented">E-Government Act</a> report.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2. Ensure Information Quality</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Your agency is already <strong>required</strong> under the Information Quality Act and associated guidelines to maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information and services provided to the public. This includes making information and services available on a timely and equitable basis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. Agencies <strong>must</strong> reasonably assure suitable information and service quality, consistent with the level of importance of the information.  Reasonable steps include: 1) clearly identifying the limitations inherent in the information dissemination product (e.g., possibility of errors, degree of reliability, and validity) so users are fully aware of the quality and integrity of the information or service, 2) taking reasonable steps to remove the limitations inherent in the information, and 3) reconsidering delivery of the information or services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3. Establish and Enforce Agency-wide Linking Policies</p>
