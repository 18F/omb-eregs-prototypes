<p>Therefore, it is recommended that Agencies: <br />1.Use their enterprise architecture and capital planning activities to plan for the deployment of IPv6-enabled network services; show how  they intend to use these services to power IPv6-enabled applications; commit to specific measureable improvements in agency performance; and reflect the same in their investment proposals.  <br />2.Leverage the guidance and common milestones provided in this document to develop an effective Transition Plan. <br />3.Set up test laboratories and/or prototype networks to acquire IPv6 experience and expertise. <br />4.Deploy secure IPv6-enabled network services,  as appropriate, during regular technology upgrade cycles.</p>
