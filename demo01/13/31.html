<p class='context'>1.4. Who should use the guidance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>1.4. Who should use the guidance - In the sense that at promulgation it represents a future scenario of operations, this guidance recommends that all involved entities take steps to develop and annually execute plans and report to the FGDC Steering Committee on their progress in implementing this guidance. The FGDC Steering Committee <strong>will</strong> annually recommend government-wide steps for achievement of the portfolio management approach, <strong>will</strong> annually report the NGDA Portfolio status to agency CFOs and CIOs and OMB, and <strong>will</strong> ensure that appropriate resources are identified in the agency budget requests to OMB. The FGDC Secretariat <strong>will</strong> consult with agencies to support definition and development of their agency-specific roles, responsibilities, and obligations through education and use of standards.</p>

<p class='context'>3.2. Inventory</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3.2. Inventory - NGDA Theme Leads, the FGDC Coordination Group, or the FGDC Steering Committee can annually create, update or replace (delete) themes and/or datasets through the collaborative review process � OMB <strong>must</strong> be informed upon the addition or deletion of NGDA Themes accepted by the FGDC Steering Committee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.4.1. NGDA Dataset Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3.4.1. NGDA Dataset Management - NGDA Dataset Managers <strong>should</strong> use the Geospatial Data Lifecycle (Reference Document: Stages of the Geospatial Data Lifecycle pursuant to OMB Circular <a href="#not-implemented">A-16</a> Sections 8(e)(d) , 8(e)(f), and 8(e)(g)) to plan, develop, maintain, evolve, and archive the NGDA Dataset(s) for which they are responsible. Figure 3 summarizes the Geospatial Data Lifecycle stages: Define Inventory/Evaluate, Obtain, Access, Maintain, Use/Evaluate, and Archive. Business requirements drive recommended management practices in each stage.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>3.4.1. NGDA Dataset Management - NGDA Dataset Managers <strong>should</strong> evaluate their NGDA Dataset(s) against the Geospatial Data Lifecycle stages in order to report on their maturity and status. They <strong>should</strong> also report on how they are conforming to the NGDA Dataset Managers� responsibilities, expended resources (dollars and full time equivalent [FTE]) staff), and other performance measures concurred upon by the FGDC Steering Committee. If funding information is not currently available, NGDA Dataset Managers <strong>should</strong> work with their agency leadership to develop means of tracking this financial information. The NGDA Dataset Manager <strong>will</strong> annually submit an NGDA Dataset Report to the relevant NGDA Theme Lead and <strong>will</strong> assist with incorporation of that information into a comprehensive annual NGDA Theme Report.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.4.2. NGDA Theme Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3.4.2. NGDA Theme Management - NGDA Theme Leads <strong>should</strong> comprehensively coordinate with their NGDA Dataset Managers to provide overall management for the NGDA Datasets associated with the NGDA Theme.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>3.4.2. NGDA Theme Management - NGDA Theme Leads <strong>will</strong> also coordinate with other NGDA Theme Leads to ensure that NGDA Datasets applicable to more than one NGDA Theme are effectively co-developed. The FGDC Secretariat <strong>will</strong> facilitate these coordination activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.5. Evaluate/Monitor</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3.5. Evaluate/Monitor - NGDA Theme Leads <strong>will</strong> develop NGDA Theme Reports that capture plans for, milestones for, and progress in establishing the necessary organizational structures and resources. Theme Lead    Agencies <strong>will</strong> submit NGDA Theme Reports to the FGDC Secretariat for summarization, and to the FGDC Coordination Group for analysis and development of a NGDA Portfolio Summary. Based on this analysis the FGDC Coordination Group <strong>will</strong> make annual recommendations to the Steering Committee on NGDA Portfolio actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.6. Identify and Execute Interagency Priorities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3.6. Identify and Execute Interagency Priorities - NGDA Theme Leads and members of the FGDC Coordination Group have roles in identifying and recommending NGDA Dataset development priorities to the FGDC Steering Committee; the FGDC Steering Committee, in turn, assesses them and makes/shares the recommendations with agency CFOs and CIOs and OMB. NGDA Theme Leads <strong>will</strong> periodically make presentations to both the FGDC Coordination Group and FGDC Steering Committee providing updates on NGDA Theme requirements as determined by their Thematic Committees and communities of interest, as incorporated in the annual NGDA Theme Report, or as requested by agency or FGDC leadership</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>3.6. Identify and Execute Interagency Priorities - The FGDC Steering Committee <strong>will</strong> be responsible for 1) assessing the recommendations in the context of overall FGDC strategic goals and objectives; 2) coming to concurrence on cross-agency NGDA Dataset development and funding priorities; and 3) presenting these recommendations to agency CFOs and OMB.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>4.2. Implementation of the Roles and Responsibilities Framework</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>4.2. Implementation of the Roles and Responsibilities Framework - The roles and responsibilities contained in this Supplemental Guidance describe activities needed for successful NGDA Portfolio management.  All agencies <strong>are encouraged</strong> to make these roles and responsibilities operational, especially those agencies that have NGDA Theme Lead responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>4. Roles and Responsibilities Pursuant to OMB Circular A�16 Section 9</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>4.3. Roles and Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>4.3. Roles and Responsibilities - In the RACI matrix, roles have been assigned to the lowest possible person or entity in the hierarchy.  For each task, at least one person or entity <strong>must</strong> be �responsible�, but again, due to the complexity of NGDA Portfolio management and the need for coordination among multiple people or entities, there <strong>may</strong> be more than one responsible party associated with each stage of the portfolio management process. For �consulted,� only those persons or entities that <strong>must</strong> be always consulted are indicated.  Consultations with persons or entities not included in this matrix <strong>may</strong> also occur, but are not always required. Detailed roles and responsibilities associated with each component of the NGDA Portfolio management process are contained in Reference Document: Roles and Responsibilities.</p>

<p class='context'>5. National Geospatial Data Asset Portfolio Investment Strategy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>5.1 Benefits</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>5.1 Benefits - The FGDC <strong>will</strong> work with OMB, NGDA Theme Leads, and NGDA Dataset Managers using the FGDC governance structure to lay out an aggressive but achievable process whereby funding levels for the NGDA Datasets become known over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>None - When developing NGDA Dataset BY funding recommendations, NGDA Theme Leads <strong>should</strong> take into account non-Federal sources of funding for the NGDA Datasets and the NGDA Dataset�s significance in meeting the needs of both Federal and non-Federal levels of government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>5.2 The Process</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>5.2 The Process - The FGDC Steering Committee communicates its BY funding recommendations for NGDA Themes and their component NGDA Datasets, plus any corresponding performance recommendations, to OMB, the relevant members of the CFO community, Executive NGDA Theme Champions, and the NGDA Theme Leads via the Executive NGDA Theme Champions. Agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> also be informed to ensure alignment with the agency�s CPIC process (late April; Step 3).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>5.2 The Process - Agency budget requests <strong>should</strong> reflect suggested FGDC investment collaboration status. Agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> be consulted to ensure alignment with respect to the agency�s CPIC process (May-September; Step 4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>5.3 Staged Process Implementation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>5.3 Staged Process Implementation - The FGDC <strong>will</strong> coordinate with OMB and the agency CFO/CIO community to ensure a consistent approach to providing the required level of resolution of financial information for NGDA Datasets, recognizing that some agencies may require more time in order to satisfy the reporting requirements.</p>
