<p class='context'>Publish Customer Service Plans</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong>will</strong> post a customer service plan ("plan") to its Open Govenment website. The plan <strong>will</strong> identify implementation steps for the customer service activities outlined in EO 13571, including a high-level discussion of the process by which a " signature initiative" to use technology to improve the customer experience <strong>will</strong> be designed and executed. The plan <strong>will</strong> prepare agencies to integrate specific customer service goals into annual agency performance plans and reports, as called for by the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRA) of 2010.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Establish a Customer Service Task Force</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To facilitate the exchange of best practices and the development of agency customer service plans and signature initiatives, OMB <strong>will</strong> coordinate a Customer Service Task Force ("Task Force"), comprised of agencies that provide significant services, that <strong>will</strong> meet regularly until agencies publish their plans.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>By June 30, 2011, each agency <strong>should</strong> identify a senior official, who will be responsible for the customer service plan and related agency goals, to represent the agency on the Task Force and submit the appropriate contact information on the MAX customer service initiative site, https://max.omb.gov/community/x/200ZIg. Before final publication in October, participating agencies will conduct a peer review of their customer service plans.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Establish a Signature Initiative</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>EO 13571 calls for each agency to <strong>establish</strong> one major initiative (a "signature initiative") that uses technology to improve the customer experience, <strong>address</strong> the gap between customer expectation and agency service delivery, and achieve efficiency gains.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Solicit Timely Customer Feedback</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) <strong>will</strong> provide guidance to agencies on the Paperwork Reduction Act and a "Fast Track" review process for efforts to gather customer feedback to improve service delivery. OIRA <strong>will</strong> post online introductory documents for program managers on different options for collecting customer feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Freeze Establishment of New Federal Executive Branch Domains</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective immediately, all agencies <strong>will</strong> cease creation of new .gov domains for 90 days. GSA's Office of Govermnentwide Policy (OGP) <strong>will</strong> approve new domains only for those requests that have received a written waiver from the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO). Should agencies need to establish new web content within this timeframe, they should leverage existing .gov sites and infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Update .Gov Domain Policy and Guidelines</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 30 days, the Federal CIO, in collaboration with GSA, <strong>will</strong> establish a task force to solicit and develop recommendations to update Federal executive branch .gov policy and guidelines and best practices for managing Federal websites.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Eliminate Duplicative and Outdated Websites</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 30 days, GSA <strong>will</strong> make publicly available on Data.gov a list of all registered top-level .gov domain names. This list <strong>will</strong> be updated regularly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Within 60 days, GSA <strong>will</strong> provide agency-specific lists on MAX and the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> issue instructions for how agencies should identify opportunities to improve content as well as eliminate duplicative and outdated websites.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Within 120 days, each agency <strong>will</strong> use the agency-specific domain name list and related instructions to identify domain names that are no longer needed, websites that should be consolidated or eliminated, and website content that needs to be improved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> post on their Open Government page the actions they <strong>will</strong> take as a result of their review.</p>
</li>
</ul>
