<p>Effective 90 days following final approval of at least one Trust Framework Provider (identified in Attachment A), agencies <strong>are to</strong> begin implementing the new requirement that will result in full implementation over the next three years by taking the following actions: -All new development of assurance Level 1<br /> web sites that allow members of the public and business partners to register or log on must be enabled to accept externally-issued<br />credentials in accordance with government-wide requirements. <br />-Existing assurance Level 1 web sites that allow members of the public and business partners to register or log on must include the requirement to accept externally-issued credentials in accordance with government-wide requirements when those sites are<br />enhanced or upgraded. Additionally, where appropriate and as resources permit, Levels 2, 3 and 4 websites that allow members of the public and business partners to register or log on should be enabled to accept externally-issued credentials at higher levels of identity assurance in accordance with government-wide requirements.</p>

<p>To ensure federal privacy and security requirements are addressed, agencies <strong>are required</strong> to follow Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy and may only accept externally issued credentials that are issued in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines and Federal Chief Information Officers Council processes. Refer to Attachment A for the current list of approved providers. For existing web sites accepting nonapproved externally-issued credentials, the agency <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> have an OMB/agency agreed-upon plan for complying with the requirement to use approved providers and schemes. Plans <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> be submitted to the Federal Chief Information Officer. Additionally, OMB and the General Services Administration (GSA) <strong>will</strong> meet with agencies to provide additional information regarding this memorandum and to share best practices. Attachment B includes the schedule of initial meetings.</p>
