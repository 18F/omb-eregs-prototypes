<p class='context'>Requirementfor Agency Implementation Plans</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This Memorandum <strong>provides</strong> guidance to Federal agencies on current reporting requirements pursuant to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (<a href="#not-implemented">FFATA</a>) as well as new requirements that agencies must employ pursuant to the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (Data Act). This Memorandum includes guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury under section 4(c) of <a href="#not-implemented">FFATA</a>, as amended.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Upon issuance, this Memorandum <strong>supersedes</strong> OMB Memoranda M-09-19, Guidance on Data Submission under FFATA (June 1, 2009) and Improving Data Quality for USAspending.gov (June 12, 2013).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OMB, in coordination with Treasury, <strong>will</strong> contact Federal agencies during May 2015 with specific information regarding any necessary changes to existing implementation plans required under prior OMB guidance. Agency points of contact <strong>will</strong> be Senior Accountable Officials (SAOs), or Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) where an SAO has not been identified. Plan revisions <strong>must include</strong> designation of an SAO who is a senior official in the agency with the ability to coordinate across multiple communities and Federal Lines of Business (LOBs), in accordance with M-10-06, Open Government Directive.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In developing their implementation plans agencies <strong>should</strong> estimate resource requirements, propose an implementation timeline, and identity any foreseeable challenges, such as competing statutory, regulatory or policy priorities, to fully implement the requirements of the DATA Act as identified in this guidance. Agencies <strong>should</strong> provide suggestions to mitigate identified challenges as well as offer recommendations for how the implementation plans will manage costs and support agency investment planning.  In addition, all agencies, particularly those who are financial management Federal Shared Service Providers (FSSPs), <strong>should</strong> include specific information about anticipated costs and timelines necessary to implement this Memorandum. Agency and FSSP plans <strong>should</strong> consider existing information technology lifecycle planning, as well as requirements for collaboration with the Chief Information Officer under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). For agencies moving to FSSPs, implementation plans <strong>should</strong> align with the move to the FSSP.</p>

<p class='context'>Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of2014</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistent with the Administration's efforts to increase transparency, achieve cost savings, and create a more data-driven government, the DATA Act directs the Administration to increase the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of Federal spending information. Among other requirements, the DATA Act <strong>amends</strong> the FF ATA by requiring publication of agency-level financial data and establishing data standards for financial data two years after the date on which this guidance is issued.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Data-Centric Implementation Approach</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to significant extent of these changes [required by the DATA Act, ref. Req. 79.05, relatively short timeframe for implementation, and absense of new appropriations for agencies to carry out this work, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and other agencies <strong>will</strong> leverage existing practices that <strong>will</strong> better position the government to meet the statutory deadlines. For instance, agencies may meet the requirement for reporting agency-level financial data in the short run by using existing processes while other work is carried out to replace today's processes with data-centric reporting. Similarly, reporting award-level information <strong>will</strong> be facilitated through use of data sources (such as procurement data in the Federal Procurement Data SystemNext Generation (FPDS-NG)) that are matched with data in other locations. This approach promotes timeliness in reporting and provides an initial solution to challenges imposed by the absence of new funding streams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>II. Requirements for Federal Agencies to Maintain Current Reporting Pursuant to FFATA</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Through the statutory deadline of May 9, 2017, agencies <strong>must</strong> follow all current transparency reporting procedures for USAspending.gov as outlined in the Award Submission Portal (ASP) User Guide for financial assistance and in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) for procurement. Agencies <strong>must</strong> ensure reported data are consistent with existing government-wide regulations, such as those listed in the FAR and 2 CFR Part 200 for Federal financial assistance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Procurement data, as provided to USAspending.gov from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS-NG or Integrated Award Environment successor), <strong>shall</strong> follow existing regulatory requirements for reporting and annual verification and validation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Financial assistance (Grants, loans, insurance, loan guarantees, cooperative agreements and other assistance) data <strong>should</strong> be submitted to the ASP [Award Submission Portal] using the Federal Assistance Awards Data System-PLUS (FAADS PLUS) format detailed at https:/ /submissions. usaspending. gov/content/ documents/U serGuide.pdf. This format is consistent with the reporting format for the Federal Assistance Award Database System (FAADS), for all financial assistance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> report financial assistance awards to individuals in an aggregate record. An aggregate record is created by taking a group of similar records and tallying the dollars based on a specific set of data fields in order to create one summary (or aggregate) record. The fields that are not used can be left blank. All transactions included in an aggregate record <strong>should</strong> belong to the same fiscal year. Agencies also may continue to report awards below the required reporting threshold in an aggregate record.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>By the statutory deadline [May 9, 2017], agency prime-level data <strong>will</strong> be in compliance with the data standards established under section 4(c) of FFATA, as amended by the DATA Act. In the interim, agencies <strong>should</strong> continue to report data to USAspending.gov under existing guidance until additional DATA Act technical guidance is issued by OMB and Treasury. Future technical guidance <strong>will</strong> provide operational guidelines describing how agencies <strong>will</strong> report these data. Any changes proposed to procurement reporting via FPDS-NG (through May 2017 and beyond) <strong>will</strong> follow appropriate rule-making procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>III. New Requirements for Federal Agencies Pursuant to the DATA Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act for additional reporting, development, and implementation of financial data standards on USAspending. gov (or its successor site), this<br />Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agency compliance with the following policies: 1. Make Agency-Level Financial Data Available for Publication. Pursuant to Section 3 of the DATA Act, by <strong>May</strong> 9, 2017, Treasury, in consultation with OMB, <strong>must</strong> publish a report of funds made available to, or expended by, a Federal agency or component of a Federal Agency on USAspending.gov (or its successor site). Reports <strong>should</strong> be published monthly, when practicable, but not less than quarterly. OMB and Treasury <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> fulfill a portion of this requirement by leveraging existing agency reporting. Concurrent with this activity: � Agencies <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> continue to submit agency-level financial data to OMB and Treasury using the Treasury Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol (GTAS) system. � OMB <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> continue to produce bulk, downloadable, machine-readable (e.g., XML) versions of the OMB SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, and post these and other outputs on its website and the White House website. The tags and other technical characteristics in OMB's XML versions of the SF 133 reports <strong>may</strong> change as a result of work on data definitions or for other reasons. � OMB and Treasury <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> make these bulk, downloadable, machine-readable versions of the SF 133 report accessible from USAspending.gov (or its successor site).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act, this<br />Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agency compliance with the following policies:] 2. Implement Data Definition Standards. OMB and/or Treasury <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> post data definition standards in a virtual repository. On the date of this Memorandum's issuance, this repository <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> serve as the authoritative source for such data definition standards pursuant to the DATA Act. Any future regulatory changes that take place as a result of these standards <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> be accomplished in accordance with existing rule-making procedures and in consultation with Federal agencies with authority over procurement and financial assistance awards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The DATA Act <strong>requires</strong> all agencies to use these data definition standards [ref. Req. 79.13] for the collection and reporting of agency-level and award-level data by two years after their issuance. Implementation efforts <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> include agency efforts to modify existing agency regulatory and non-regulatory policies (if required), business processes, and, as needed, systems to support agency-level financial reporting and new data quality requirements under this Memorandum. Agencies <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> modify policies, internal business processes, and/or information technology, as needed, to ensure consistent publication of agency-level and award level reporting under the DATA Act and FF AT A on USAspending.gov (or its successor site).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agency compliance with the following policies:] 3. Implement Data Exchange Standards. To publish Federal spending data on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), agencies <strong>will</strong> be <strong>required</strong> to provide data to Treasury under the "data-centric" approach using a standard data exchange ("DATA Act Schema"). This DATA Act Schema includes a standard taxonomy and a standard format, or "language", for exchanging data and provides a comprehensive view of the data definition standards and their relationships to one another. Treasury has created a draft DATA Act Schema for financial data based upon a subset of U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL). The schema is being further developed and refined based on feedback from federal and non-federal stakeholders and additional components <strong>will</strong> be created to capture award-level data elements. The Schema can be found here http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/dataexchange-standard/. The DATA Act Schema <strong>will</strong> be revised periodically to reflect statutory/regulatory changes and append additional data elements. Further, additional components of the DATA Act Schema that capture other data elements <strong>will</strong> be created in the future as needed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Treasury is piloting the data exchange concept [ref. Req. 79.15] with select agencies and <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> issue further guidance and tools, such as open source code and a technical implementation guide, once the pilots are complete. Treasury <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> provide technical assistance to agencies as they adopt the standard exchange format and taxonomy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p class='context'>IV. Requirements to Ensure Data Quality and Future Reporting Capabilities, consistent with DATA Act Implementation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To ensure the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agencies to: 1. Continue to <strong>Assign</strong> a Unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) for Financial Assistance Awards. All Federal agencies <strong>must</strong> continue to <strong>assign</strong> a unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) to each financial assistance award. Once an agency assigns a FAIN and reports it to USAspending.gov, the Federal agency may not, except in limited circumstances, modify the FAIN during the life of the award. Further, once a Federal agency assigns a FAIN, that Federal agency <strong>must</strong> ensure that the FAIN is clearly identified in all Federal award documents. As a term and condition of the award, Federal agencies <strong>must</strong> require that all recipients report subaward information by FAIN into the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). Federal procurement awards continue to be subject to the requirements for uniform procurement instrument identification numbers in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 4.16.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To <strong>ensure</strong> the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agencies to:] 2. <strong>Ensure</strong> Availability of Agency-Level and Award-Level Financial Data Sourced from Agency Financial Systems and Implement Linkage between Agency Financial System(s) and Management Systems Using Award IDs. To improve the quality of agencies' prime award-level Federal spending data required under FFATA, agencies <strong>will be required</strong> to make available financial obligation and outlay data, for both agency-level data (pursuant to Section 3(b) of FFATA, as amended) and award-level data (pursuant to Section 2(b)(l)(B) of FFATA) based on agency financial system(s).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To implement this requirement [to ensure availability of agency-level and award-level financial data sourced from<br />agency financial systems and implement linkage between agency financial fystem(s) and management systems using award IDs, ref. Req. 79.18] agencies <strong>will be required</strong> to carry the prime award ID in agency financial systems, in order to link between an accounting transaction and an award. The award identification (FAIN for financial assistance and Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) for procurement) serves as the key to associate data across award systems and financial systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies moving to financial management Federal Shared Service Providers (FSSPs) <strong>should</strong> consult with their FSSPs to identify appropriate timelines for inclusion in agency implementation plans required under this Memorandum. This linkage will facilitate timely reporting of award level financial data, reduce reporting errors, and serve as the primary mechanism moving forward for associating expenditures with individual awards as required by FFATA and the DATA Act.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To ensure the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agencies to:] 3. <strong>Report</strong> All Prime Financial Assistance Awards Above the Micro-Purchase<br />Threshold on a Bi-Weekly Cycle. Currently, pursuant to FFATA, Federal agencies <strong>report</strong>, at least bi-weekly, transactions related to prime awards $25,000 or greater. Agencies <strong>will be required</strong> to submit specific programmatic information about all financial assistance and procurement prime awards greater than the micro purchase threshold (as defined by FAR 2.101) to USAspending.gov within two years of the date of this Memorandum. Agencies currently <strong>report</strong> all procurement awards above the micro purchase threshold to FPDS-NG, which are made available via USAspending.gov, in accordance with current policy.</p>
