<p>This memorandum builds on the Administration's successful efforts and establishes a broad strategic sourcing initiative to ensure that all agencies <strong>manage</strong> their acquisitions effectively and that, wherever possible, agencies join together to negotiate the best deal for the taxpayer.</p>

<p>While every agency <strong>must</strong> eliminate inefficiencies from its acquisition processes, this initiative puts additional responsibilities for designing and implementing government-wide strategic sourcing solutions on large agencies, which make up the vast majority of all Federal contracting.</p>

<p class='context'>I. Designation of Strategic Sourcing Accountable Officials (SSAOs) by CFO Act Agencies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the head of each of the 24 Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies <strong>shall</strong> designate a Strategic Sourcing Accountable Official (SSAO), who will have the authority to coordinate the agency's internal strategic sourcing activities and its participation in government wide efforts, such as those described below. Each agency <strong>shall</strong> send the proposed SSAO's name and contact information to OMB by January 15, 2013.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Il. Establishment of the Interagency Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council (SSLC)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council (SSLC) <strong>shall</strong>, in consultation with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the Chief Financial Officers Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Performance Improvement Council, and other interagency councils as necessary, lead the government's efforts to increase the use of government-wide management and sourcing of goods and services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The SSLC <strong>will</strong> meet regularly to provide long-term leadership of the government's strategic sourcing efforts as well as to take actions that save taxpayer dollars now.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To that end, by March 2013, the SSLC <strong>shall</strong> submit to OMB a set of recommendations for management strategies for specific goods and services � including several IT commodities identified through the PortfolioStat process - that would ensure that the Federal government receives the most favorable offer possible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    identify at least five products and/or services for which new government-wide acquisition vehicles or management approaches should be developed and made mandatory, to the maximum extent practicable, for the SSLC agencies;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�   for these identified commodities and solutions, provide a supporting spend analysis, estimate savings opportunities, and define metrics for tracking progress;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    identify existing contract vehicles and relevant contract renewal dates that could be used to develop transition strategies to the new solutions;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�     identify agencies that should serve as "executive agents" to lead the development of each of these new solutions (with the assistance of interagency teams comprised of agency experts);</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�       propose plans and management strategies to maximize the use of each strategic sourcing effort;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�        propose vendor management or other strategies that could be used to reduce the variability in the prices paid for similar goods and services, where the development of new government-wide vehicles may not be immediately feasible; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�          propose other savings strategies that could be implemented, such as adapting existing vehicles (e.g., Multiple Award Schedules, GWACs, and Multi-agency Contracts) to ensure that certain characteristics of strategic sourcing are followed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each of the SSLC agencies <strong>shall</strong> promote, to the maximum extent practicable, sound strategic sourcing practices within their agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each SSLC agency <strong>shall</strong> establish an internal cross-functional strategic sourcing council to oversee the agency's related activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 74.01-74.15] These efforts include, but are not limited to, issuing and <strong>enforcing</strong> mandatory use policies for government wide and agency wide strategic sourcing solutions to the extent appropriate, providing acquisition and management data to the General Services Administration and other executive agents in support of the development of new solutions, and tracking spending and savings information for use by OMB, as further directed by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Ill. Additional Responsibilities of the General Services Administration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <strong>shall</strong>:<br />�� implement, in consultation with the SSLC, at least five new government-wide strategic sourcing solutions in each of FY 2013 and FY 2014;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <strong>shall</strong>:<br />�� increase the transparency of prices paid for common goods and services for use by agency officials in market research and negotiations; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <strong>shall</strong>:<br />�� as needed, promulgate requirements, regulations, and best practices for acquiring, using, and, where applicable, disposing of the commodities managed through strategic sourcing initiatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>IV. Characteristics of Strategic Sourcing Acquisition Vehicles</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />� reflect input from a large number of potential agency users � especially the largest likely users � regarding customer demand for the goods and services being considered, the acquisition strategy (including contract pricing, delivery and other terms and conditions, and performance requirements), and the commodity management approach;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�  ensure that the Federal government gets credit for all sales provided under that vehicle, regardless of payment method, unless the sales are identified with other government contracts, so that volume-based pricing discounts can be applied;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    include tiered pricing, or other appropriate strategies, to reduce prices as cumulative sales volume increases;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    require vendors to provide sufficient pricing, usage, and performance data to enable the government to improve their commodity management practices on an ongoing basis; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�      be supported by a contract administration plan that demonstrates commitment by the executive agent to perform active commodity management and monitor vendor performance and pricing changes throughout the life of the contract to ensure the benefits of strategic sourcing are maintained.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>V. Increasing Small Business Opportunities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the maximum extent practicable, all strategic sourcing opportunities <strong>shall</strong> seek to increase participation by small businesses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All proposed strategic sourcing agreements <strong>must</strong> baseline small business use under current strategies and set goals to meet or exceed that baseline participation under the new strategic sourcing vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
