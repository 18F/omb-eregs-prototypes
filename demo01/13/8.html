<p class='context'>Policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative], as described in this memorandum, requires agencies to develop and report on data center strategies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Leadership and Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All data center infrastructure and services, including contracts for third-party data centers and services agency-wide, <strong>shall</strong> be managed by the agency CIO in a manner consistent with FITARA and OMB Memorandum M-15-14, �Management and Oversight of Information Technology.�</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The agency CIO <strong>shall</strong> be responsible for implementing and measuring progress toward meeting the goals set forth in this memorandum.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Transition to Cloud and Data Center Shared Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Development Freeze for New and Current Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning 180 days after issuance of this memorandum, agencies <strong>may</strong> not budget any funds or resources toward initiating a new data center or significantly expanding an existing data center without approval from OMB OFCIO. [Footnote:] Data centers certified by GSA OGP as Inter agency Shared Service Provider data centers are excluded from this development freeze.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Footnote for Req. 21.03] The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) <strong>will</strong> coordinate with OMB to define thresholds for what constitutes �significant� expansion within 60 days of publication of this memorandum.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To request such approval [ref. Req. 21.05], agencies <strong>must</strong> submit a written justification that includes an analysis of alternatives (including opportunities for cloud services, inter-agency shared services, and third party co-location) and an explanation of the net reduction in the agency�s data center inventory that will be facilitated by the new or expanded data center (such as through consolidation of multiple existing data centers into a single new data center).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Consolidation and Closure of Existing Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As previously required by the FDCCI [Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative], agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to principally reduce application, system, and database inventories to essential enterprise levels by increasing the use of virtualization to enable pooling of storage, network and computer resources, and dynamic allocation on-demand.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> evaluate options for the consolidation and closure of existing data centers, by (in order of priority): <br />1. Transitioning to provisioned services, including configurable and flexible technology such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to the furthest extent practicable, consistent with the Cloud First policy.<br />2. Migrating to inter-agency shared services or co-location data centers.<br />3. Migrating to more optimized data centers within the agency�s data center inventory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Cloud Investment</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistent with the Cloud First policy, agencies <strong>shall</strong> use cloud infrastructure where possible when planning new mission or support applications or consolidating existing applications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> take into consideration cost, security requirements, and application needs when evaluating cloud environments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As required by <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a>, agencies utilizing cloud services <strong>shall</strong> do so in a manner that is consistent with requirements of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (<a href="#not-implemented">FedRAMP</a>) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Shared Services Managing Partner</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To support the shared services efforts described by this memorandum, the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) <strong>shall</strong> serve as the managing partner of the Federal Government�s data center line of business  and data center shared services.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Optimization of Physical Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Classification of Physical Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> perform a comprehensive review of their data center inventories and continue to maintain complete and updated data center inventories. This comprehensive review <strong>shall</strong> be completed by August 31, 2016, to align with the Integrated Data Collection (IDC) process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Data centers <strong>shall</strong> be categorized into two groups: tiered data centers and non-tiered data centers. [Footnote:] The term �tiered� and the definitions that follow are derived from the Uptime Institute�s Tier Classification System; however, this <strong>shall</strong> not be construed as requiring any certification in order for a data center to be considered tiered by OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Private sector-provided cloud services <strong>are not</strong> considered data centers for the purposes of this memorandum, but <strong>must</strong> continue to be included in agencies' quarterly inventory data submissions to OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> self-classify data centers as either tiered or non-tiered data centers based on the above criteria; however, any data center previously reported to OMB as a Tier 1-4 data center <strong>shall</strong> be automatically categorized as a tiered data center.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Tiered data centers <strong>are</strong> defined as those that utilize each of the following: 1) a separate physical space for IT infrastructure; 2) an uninterruptible power supply; 3) a dedicated cooling system or zone; and 4) a backup power generator for prolonged power outages. All other data centers shall be considered non-tiered data centers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Energy Metering and Power Efficiency</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> install automated energy metering tools and <strong>shall</strong> use these to collect and report energy usage data in their data centers to OMB. The March 19, 2015, <a href="#not-implemented">Executive Order 13693</a>, "Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade," requires agencies to install and monitor advanced energy meters in data centers by September 30, 2018.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the Implementing Instructions for <a href="#not-implemented">Executive Order 13693</a> (E.O. Implementing Instructions), energy metering tools <strong>shall</strong> enable the active tracking of PUE for the data center and <strong>shall</strong> be installed in all tiered Federal data centers by September 30, 2018. [Footnote:] While <a href="#not-implemented">Executive Order 13693</a> requires advanced energy metering in all data centers, OMB will monitor PUE [power usage effectiveness] for tiered data centers only.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The E.O. Implementing Instructions also advise that "[a]ll existing and new data centers <strong>shall</strong> have at least one certified Data Center Energy Practitioner (DCEP) assigned to manage its performance."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, agency CIOs are also required under this memorandum to ensure that existing tiered data centers achieve and maintain a PUE [power usage effectiveness] of less than 1.5 by September 30, 2018.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency CIOs <strong>shall</strong> evaluate options for consolidation or closure of existing data centers in which a PUE [power usage effectiveness] target of less than 1.5 is not cost-effective, such as through transition to cloud services or migration to inter-agency shared services data centers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[�] OMB <strong>will</strong> monitor the energy efficiency of data center power and cooling infrastructure through the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, effective immediately, all new data centers <strong>must</strong> implement energy metering capable of measuring PUE [power usage effectiveness] and <strong>must</strong> be designed and operated to maintain a PUE no greater than 1.4, and are encouraged to be designed and operated to achieve a PUE no greater than 1.2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To the extent permissible under the <a href="#not-implemented">Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)</a>, agencies <strong>must</strong> include PUE [power usage effectiveness] requirements for all new data center contracts or procurement vehicles.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] any new data center contract or procurement vehicle <strong>must require</strong> the contractor to report the quarterly average PUE [power usage effectiveness] of the contracted facility to the contracting agency, except where that data center�s PUE is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies <strong>are encourage</strong>d to require the same for extension of existing vehicles. [Footnote:] This can be PUE for the facility as a whole in cases where the agency only contracts for a portion of a larger facility; however, if PUE metrics are available specific to the agency�s use, that is preferred.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>PUE [power usage effectiveness] reporting <strong>is not</strong> required for cloud services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Automated Infrastructure Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> replace manual collections and reporting of systems, software, and hardware inventory housed within data centers with automated monitoring, inventory, and management tools (e.g., data center infrastructure management) by the end of fiscal year 2018. These tools  <strong>shall</strong> provide the capability to, at a minimum, measure progress toward the server utilization and virtualization metrics defined in the Metric Target Values section of this memorandum. [Footnote:] For non-tiered data centers, only automated monitoring of server utilization <strong>is required</strong>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any data center initiation, significant expansion, or migration project that receives Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DM&E) funds in fiscal year 2017 and beyond <strong>must</strong> immediately implement automated monitoring and management tools. However, agencies are strongly encouraged to implement automated monitoring and management tools throughout their data centers immediately.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To the extent permissible under the FAR, agencies <strong>must</strong> include automated infrastructure management requirements for all new data center service contracts or procurement vehicles. Further, any new data center contractor procurement vehicle <strong>must</strong> require the contractor to report to the contracting agency whether the contracted facility utilizes automated infrastructure management, except where such data is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies <strong>are encouraged</strong> to require the same for extension of existing vehicles.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA <strong>shall</strong> make available an acquisition vehicle for automated monitoring and management tools to support agency needs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once established, agencies <strong>shall not</strong> issue new solicitations for these requirements unless they have developed a business case, approved by the agency�s CIO and shared with OMB, to establish that the separate procurement of these needs results in better value, considering price and other appropriate factors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Metric Target Values</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB <strong>will</strong> measure agency progress for this initiative [data center optimization] using the following optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies' quarterly data center inventory submissions. These optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all data centers at agency facilities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Table 1. Government-wide Optimization Targets for Tiered Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority. Agencies <strong>shall</strong> achieve and maintain all listed target values by the end of fiscal year 2018:<br />[Metric:] Energy Metering.<br />[Definition:] (%) Percent of total gross floor area (GFA) in an agency�s tiered data center inventory located in tiered data centers that have power metering.<br />[FYE 2018 Target Value:] 100%<br /><br />[Metric] Power Usage Effectiveness PUE<br />[Definition:] (%) Proportion of total data center energy used by IT equipment. <br />[FYE 2018 Target Value:] ? 1.5 (? 1.4 for new data centers)<br /><br />[Metric] Virtualization<br />[Definition:] (Ratio) Ratio of operating systems (OS) to physical servers. <br />[FYE 2018 Target Value:] ? 4<br /><br />[Metric] Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring<br />[Definition:] (%) Percent of time busy  (measured as 1 �  percent of time spent idle), measured directly by continuous, <br />automated monitoring software,  discounted by the fraction of data centers fully equipped with automated monitoring.<br />[FYE 2018 Target Value:] ? 65%<br /><br />[Metric:] Facility Utilization <br />[Definition:] (%) Portion of total gross  floor area in tiered data centers that is actively utilized for racks that contain IT equipment.<br />[FYE 2018 Target Value:] ? 80%<br /><br />Only the Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring optimization metric <strong>shall</strong> apply to nontiered data centers. High-performance computing (HPC) nodes can be excluded from calculations of Virtualization and Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong>, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce Government-wide annual costs attributable to physical data centers by at least 25%, relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure Spending data submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard. Agencies <strong>shall</strong> collectively achieve the following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost avoidance) in each of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018:<br />[Table 2: Cost Savings Target:]<br />FY2014 Physical Data Center Spending: $5.4 billion <br />Total Savings Targeted by FYE 2018: $2.7 billion.<br /><br />[Footnotes] [Spending data] Benchmarked against the sum of all non cloud data center costs (including data center labor, software, hardware, electricity, and facility) found in physical data center fields of the IT Inventory Summary Table of the IT Dashboard.<br />[Footnote:] Consistent with <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-131</a>, the term �cost savings� refers to �a reduction in actual expenditures below the projected level of costs to achieve a specific objective,� and the term �cost avoidance� refers to �an action taken in the immediate time frame that will decrease costs in the future."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO <strong>will</strong> set individual cost savings and cost avoidance goals for each agency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Goal 3: Closed Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies <strong>shall</strong> close at least 25% of tiered data centers government-wide, excluding those approved as inter-agency shared services provider data centers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[By the end of FY 2018] agencies <strong>must</strong> close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government wide.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> prioritize the closure of data centers that are unable to meet applicable PUE [power usage effectiveness] optimization targets and/or pose management or security challenges due to age.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the long term, all agencies <strong>should</strong> continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers <strong>are required</strong> to be closed before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as temporary and work to close them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO <strong>will</strong> share with each agency its individual goal for data center closures, specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered data centers the agency must close. OMB may exclude from these agency-specific targets data centers that are physically inseparable from non-IT hardware (e.g. simulation and modeling devices, sensors, etc.) and that perform a specific, non-standard set of tasks (e.g. do not provide general purpose computing or storage services to Federal facilities).</p>
