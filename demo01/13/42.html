<p class='context'>Standard Configurations</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective immediately, CIOs <strong>shall</strong> ensure that at least 80% of their agency's new basic laptop and desktop requirements are satisfied with one of the standard configurations posted on the Acquisition Gateway (at https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/) unless an exception is consistent with an approved IT acquisition strategy or plan, as required by OMB's FITARA implementation guidance, and approved in writing by the agency CIO.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Moving to a More Consolidated Acquisition Strategy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective immediately, except as provided in this policy, all agencies are prohibited from issuing new solicitations for laptops and desktops, and civilian agencies <strong>shall</strong> leverage the following existing vehicles, which were determined by the CMLC [Category Management Leadership Council] to offer the best value for the bulk of the Government's laptop and desktop needs: <br />1) NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP)7 <br />2) General Services Administration (GSA) IT Schedule 708 <br />3) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), NITAAC Chief Information Officer-Commodities and Solutions (CIO-CS)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Exception [to Reqs. 80.01-80.02] for agency-wide, mandatory-use vehicles: Agencies may continue the use of mandatory agency-wide vehicles through the end of the current base or option period, as applicable. To qualify for an exemption, agencies are <strong>required</strong> to implement category management principles in the administration of those vehicles and must, at a minimum: <br />a)appoint an agency category lead for laptops and desktop, who will also actively participate in the WCT [Workstation Category Team]; <br />b) measure and report rates of compliance by bureau, and monitor and address noncompliant spend outside of the mandated vehicle; <br />c) post the agency's mandatory use policy and critical contract data, including terms and conditions, and maintain prices paid on the Acquisition Gateway within 90 days of issuance of this policy; 11 and <br />d) comply with additional guidance identified by OMB or the CMLC [Category Management Leadership Council] to ensure that the agency-wide vehicle continues to deliver the maximum benefit to the agency and that best practices and pricing are shared widely among the acquisition and IT community. <br /><br />Six (6) months prior to the exercise of each additional option period, the agency shall analyze terms/conditions, pricing, performance, fees, and savings under the agency vehicle relative to the approved vehicles, document findings, and provide this information to OMB for approval. Eighteen (18) months prior to any recompetition of these solutions, the agency must submit a business case to OMB that outlines how the agency will transition to the identified vehicles above or how they will make their solution available government-wide, if applicable (transition plan requirements are provided below). Agencies with bureau-wide agreements, or agencies that cannot meet the category management exemption criteria listed above, must transition to the CMLC-approved vehicles by October 1, 2016.</p>

<p>[The following is in reference to Policy 82] If a procuring agency would like to fulfill a follow-on or renewable acquisition outside fo the 8(a) Program, it <strong>must</strong> make a written request to and receive the concurrence fo SBA in accordance with the regulations set for at 13 CFR 124.504(d).</p>

<p class='context'>Improving Demand Management Practices</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adopt uniform refresh cycles- Agencies <strong>shall</strong> develop and implement policies and procedures in which only a portion of the laptops and desktops are at the end of their useful life and need to be replaced each year. Generally, agency CIOs <strong>shall</strong> adopt a uniform refresh cycle, such as replacing 25% of inventory every year for 4 years or 20% of inventory every year for 5 years.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Aggregate demand to support leveraged buying events - Agencies <strong>should</strong> focus the bulk of their acquisition of laptops and desktops on publicized buying events to maximize the Government's collective buying power. A best practice is to host semi-annual buying events where requirements across agencies are consolidated to leverage buying and drive down costs, and the WCT [Workstation Category Team] will require this practice for GSA Schedule 70, NITAAC CIO-CS, and NASA SEWP. Furthermore, the WCT will work with GSA to create tools on the Acquisition Gateway to help organizations consolidate requirements to better leverage their spending. Agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, participate in these buying events.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Defining the Responsibilities of Laptop and Desktop Category Lead and Contract Manager</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The WCT [Workstation Category Team] <strong>will</strong> serve as the Category Lead for laptops and desktops moving forward. In this capacity, the WCT <strong>will</strong>: <br />a) seek input from agency CIOs to revise and issue new standard configurations every six months <br />b) initiate work on additional standard configurations based on special usage cases, and begin to identify standard configurations for tablets and hybrids to ensure a consistent approach to acquiring and managing these devices; <br />c) seek input from users, including contracting officers, program managers, security officers, and technology officers, to evaluate the performance, value and fees of the approved contract vehicles; <br />d) evaluate vendor performance and pricing; and <br />e) based on the factors above, recommend to OMB on an annual basis: modifications to the list of approved vehicles and improvements for how the Federal Government buys and manages laptops and desktops.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The contract managers of the CMLC [Category Management Leadership Council]-approved vehicles <strong>will</strong>: <br />a) negotiate threshold discounts based on volume to maximize savings for agencies, and provide timely notifications to agencies; <br />b) work with customer agencies to present an agency-specific standard image on the hardware, leveraging any enterprise license agreements, and incorporate into contracts as opportunities arise; <br />c) provide data to the WCT [Workstation Category Team] and the Acquisition Gateway within 90 days and at least every six months thereafter to evaluate pricing, fees, and performance of the contracts; <br />d) report on agency compliance with the requirement to purchase standard configurations; <br />e) evaluate customer/user feedback on vendor performance, offerings, value, customer support on a regular basis and address concerns as needed, in accordance with recent OFPP guidance 14 ; <br />f) work with agencies to develop forecasts for acquisition requirements; and <br />g) sponsor buying events, as appropriate, to aggregate demand.</p>

<p class='context'>Transition Plans and Goals</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To ensure that agencies are able to meet or exceed the schedule and the goals of this policy, civilian CFO Act agency Chief Information Officers and Chief Acquisition Officers have joint, but unique, responsibilities for implementation. Working together, the CIOs and CAOs <strong>shall</strong> develop short transition and implementation plans that address both the new technical and new acquisition requirements set forth in this memorandum. <br /><br />CAOs are responsible for leading the transition to the preferred vehicles and <strong>shall</strong>: <br />a) provide baseline spend data for purchases made through the approved vehicles; <br />b) identify when the agency will phase out existing contracts for laptops and desktops and transition to the preferred vehicles; <br />c) identify how overall small business participation will continue to be met or exceeded; and <br />d) identify current agency-wide vehicles required by mandatory use policies that are proposed to continue because of excellent pricing and performance and other information required in the exceptions section above.</p>

<p>Treating laptops and desktops like a commercial commodity will help the Government drive efficiency in this category. However, most agencies have some nuanced requirements that either do not neatly fit into the standard configurations profiles above or are not offered on these vehicles. As such, the goal of this policy is not intended to drive 100% of civilian spend to CMLC-approved contracts, but rather to phase in the policy over time to achieve a Governmentwide goal of 75% by the end of FY18 (agency rates may be higher depending on their needs and policies). The table below <strong>identifies</strong> the phase-in requirements for the Government over time [shown as a list below]: <br /><br />FY 2016: 45%<br />FY 2017: 60%<br />FY 2018: 75%</p>
