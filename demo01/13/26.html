<p>First, effective immediately, the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) <strong>will</strong> undertake detailed reviews of the highest-risk IT projects across the Federal Government. Agencies <strong>will</strong> be required to present improvement plans to the CIO for projects that are behind schedule or over budget. Where serious problems are identified and cannot be corrected, further actions should be taken, including potential adjustments to Fiscal Year 2012 agency budgets. Within 30 days, the CIO shall issue guidance on how this review process <strong>will</strong> be conducted.</p>

<p>Second, concurrent with this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is <strong>directing</strong> executive departments and agencies to refrain from awarding new task orders or contracts for financial system modernization projects � an area of persistent problems � pending review and approval by OMB. This guidance specifies the timing and parameters of the review process, including specific rules designed to significantly reduce the size, cost, and complexity of financial system modernization projects.</p>

<p>Third, OMB�s Deputy Director for Management <strong>shall</strong> develop recommendations, within 120 days and in consultation with agencies, for improving the Federal Government �s IT<br />procurement and management practices. These recommendations <strong>shall</strong> address the root causes of problems plaguing Federal IT projects by strengthening existing policies and procedures where appropriate, eliminating outdated and cumbersome rules, and focusing on proven best practices from inside and outside the Federal Government. They will include higher standards for project management practices and personnel, additional mechanisms for holding managers accountable for project results, and more rigorous review processes.</p>
