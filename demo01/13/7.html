<p class='context'>Introduction</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Strategy Principles</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An �Information-Centric� approach � Moves us from managing �documents� to managing discrete pieces of open data and content which can be tagged, shared, secured, mashed up and presented in the way that is most useful for the consumer of that information. [Footnote:] Open data and content for the purposes of this document refers to digital information that is structured and exposed in a way that makes it accessible for meaningful use beyond its system of origin, be that internal to the government or external to the public.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A �Shared Platform� approach � Helps us work together, both within and across agencies, to reduce costs, streamline development, apply consistent standards, and ensure consistency in how we create and deliver information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A �Customer-Centric� approach � Influences how we create, manage, and present data through websites, mobile applications, raw data sets, and other modes of delivery, and allows customers to shape, share and consume information, whenever and however they want it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A platform of �Security and Privacy� � Ensures this innovation happens in a way that ensures the safe and secure delivery and use of digital services to protect information and privacy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
