<p class='context'>Section I. New E-Gov Act Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. Agency head responsibilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>are</strong> to use the provisions of the <a href="#not-implemented">E-Government Act</a> and this guidance to interact more successfully with citizens. For example, agencies should continue to use existing guidance, authorities, and procedures to choose IT investments via the agency�s capital planning and investment control process, and to ensure that such investments <strong>are</strong> part of the agency�s blueprint for modernizing its IT architecture (known as the agency�s enterprise architecture).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency business processes <strong>should</strong> fulfill the needs of citizens, and as such, an agency <strong>should</strong> be willing to reorganize the ways it conducts business transactions with the public in order to accomplish this goal. This may include expanding initiatives that the agency is already undertaking, such as those that are part of the agency�s implementation of the President�s Management Agenda. Any changes to agency business processes <strong>should</strong> further the President�s goal of a citizen centered government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to:<br />� <strong>Define</strong> and <strong>deliver</strong> performance increases that matter to citizens -- Agencies are already required under <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-11</a>, the <a href="#not-implemented">Clinger-Cohen Act</a>, and the <a href="#not-implemented">Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)</a> to establish performance goals for IT and to link such goals to strategic plans. The E-Government Act builds on this process -- agencies <strong>are to</strong> develop performance measures for e-government that are both citizen and productivity-related (see section 202). These performance measures <strong>must</strong> be linked with the agency�s Annual Performance Plan and the agency�s Strategic Plan and used to meet agency objectives, strategic goals, and statutory mandates in E-Government and IT.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to:<br />� Communicate policies within and across agencies � Agencies are already responsible for ensuring that a Chief Information Officer (CIO) oversees the agency�s IT portfolio and identifies opportunities for partnership with other agencies under the <a href="#not-implemented">Clinger Cohen Act</a>. Accordingly, the agency CIO <strong>will</strong> serve as the primary official for assisting agency heads in implementing the E-government Act and this guidance in the agency. In addition, agency heads, through the agency CIO, <strong>will</strong> distribute this guidance throughout the agency.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to:<br />� Comply with section 508 to ensure accessibility -- The Act requires agencies to continue to comply with section 508 of the <a href="#not-implemented">Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. �794d)</a> in carrying out the provisions of the Act (see section 202(d)).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1. Requirements of all agencies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>a. Agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to make their public regulatory dockets electronically accessible and searchable using Regulations.gov, the President's E-Rulemaking e-government initiative (see Section 206(d)). Agencies are also expected to accept electronic submissions to the online dockets. Consistent with Section 206(e) of the Act, OMB plans to issue a timeline for agency compliance with the provisions of section 206 by means of the activities of the Online Rulemaking E-Government initiative.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>b. Agencies <strong>must</strong> conduct Privacy Impact Assessments for new IT investments and online information collections, consistent with OMB�s forthcoming guidance on the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act (see Section 208).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>c. Agency heads <strong>must</strong> establish and operate IT training programs, taking advantage of learning partnerships, such as the GoLearn.gov online training portal for government employees (see Section 209(b)(2)). This new requirement will be integrated with the human capital initiative under the President�s Management Agenda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>B. Agency CIOs.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[...] he agency CIO <strong>will</strong> serve as the primary official for assisting agency heads in implementing the Act and this guidance in the agency. Agency CIOs are already expected to lead work under their agency�s investment review board (IRB) to identify investments that further the agency�s mission and programs in delivering services and information to citizens. In addition, agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> work with the IRB to identify and pursue investments that could be shared across the agency or with other agencies to address similar missions and constituencies. Agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> continue to ensure that e-government investments are reviewed as part of the agency�s budget and capital investment process (i.e., developing a capital asset plan and business case) and that these processes are aligned with the agency�s Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1. General Policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In implementing the Act and this guidance, agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> consult key stakeholders throughout their agencies, including program and project managers, content managers, librarians, public affairs representatives, records managers, and human resources managers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> also consider the following when selecting IT investments:<br />� delivering services and information to citizens electronically;<br />� reducing burden on citizens and businesses;<br />� determining that the investment is part of the agency�s modernization blueprint;<br />� ensuring interoperability of systems; and � simplifying business processes and reusing technology where applicable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2. Specific CIO requirements under the Act</p>
