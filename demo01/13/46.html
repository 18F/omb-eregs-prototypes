<p>Section 508 of the Rehabi litation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (E&IT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs, which reduces barriers to job success and mobility. The law also helps to ensure that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. The purpose of this letter is to remind Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of their collaborative roles in this area and to suggest activities and tools to help agencies fulfill their responsibilities in implementing the law. <br /><br />The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to acquire accessible E&IT unless an exception applies and is documented. Consideration of the Section 508 standards must be part of the procurement planning process, market research, and requirements definition, and the standards must be included in all applicable solicitations. The General Services Administration (GSA), as part of their statutory requirement to provide technical support for Section 508, assesses the extent to which agencies properly include applicable Section 508 standards using a sampling process of solicitations posted on FedBizOpps over the past few months. Across all agencies, a recent assessment by GSA showed that only 3% of the solicitations that included E&IT properly included the Section 508 standards. While some of the solicitations sampled included references to Section 508, a compliant document must, among other requirements, articulate the specific 508 standards that apply to that solicitation. <br /><br />These results demonstrate we are not adequately incorporating applicable Section 508 standards when acquiring E&IT. CAOs and CIOs should review their procurement and information technology acquisition policies and procedures to validate that the Section 508 standards are appropriately considered and clearly stated in solicitation documents. CAOs should consider sampling agency procurements that include E&IT to ensure they properly specify the appropriate Section 508 standards. Procurements that do not meet the standards should be amended. The attachment includes the assessment criteria that GSA uses, and CAOs should consider using these or similar criteria in their sampling effort. <br /><br />CIOs also have specific obligations to help ensure the applicable Section 508 standards are included in procurements for E&IT. Section 8(b)(xiii) of OMB Circular A- 130, �Management of Federal Information Resources,� requires agencies to ensure selected systems or processes facilitate accessibility under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and CIOs are responsible for monitoring agency implementation.  Additionally, Sections 53 and 300 of OMB Circular A-11, �Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget,� instruct agencies to ensure IT capital planning and control comply with Section 508 requirements.2 CIOs should instruct agency project managers to review capital planning and investment control documentation for compliance with Section 508. <br /><br />As part of its ongoing technical assistance and sampling activities, GSA�s Office of Information Technology Accessibility and Workforce may contact your Section 508 coordinator and the points of contact listed in solicitations that appear not to be compliant to offer additional assistance. <br /><br />A resource available to agencies is the Buy Accessible Wizard at www.buyaccessible.gov. This free tool guides requiring officials through the steps necessary to conduct acquisitions that comply with Section 508. CAOs and CIOs may incorporate the use of this tool into their procurement procedures to improve compliance with the law. Another resource is www.Section508.gov, which has information and free on-line training courses.</p>
