<p>With increased focus on data sharing, agencies <strong>must</strong> pay close attention to handling responsibly their own data and the data they share with or receive from other agencies. When information about individuals is involved, agencies <strong>must</strong> pay especially close attention to privacy interests and <strong>must</strong> incorporate measures to safeguard those interests. Prior to any data sharing, agencies <strong>must</strong> review and meet the Privacy Act requirements for computer matching, including developing a computer matching agreement and publishing notice of the proposed match in the�Federal Register; OMB Guidance on Computer Matching (54�Fed. Reg.�25818, June 19, 1989); and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I, "Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals." Agencies <strong>must</strong> also review and meet applicable requirements under other laws, including the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</p>

<p>[The following is language from ATTACHMENT: Privacy Principles in Conducting Inter-Agency Data Sharing, follow link for full attachment] <br />6. Minimization.<br />When dealing with paper records, it may be difficult to provide only certain data elements to other agencies, because of the need for manual redaction of other information. In the computer world, it is far easier to implement sharing of only a narrow range of information that is necessary to verify an applicant's eligibility for a program. Agencies <strong>should</strong> analyze what data are needed for program purposes and make every effort to ensure that they transfer only that information.<br /><br />7. Accountability.<br />Data sharing programs <strong>should</strong> include mechanisms to ensure that agencies are accountable for adhering to these principles. Some of these measures are already found in the Privacy Act, which provides for civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Agencies <strong>should</strong> also consider training programs that stress accountability and explain penalties for breaches of confidentiality. Especially for more sensitive data and more extensive data sharing arrangements, agencies <strong>should</strong> consider whether additional oversight mechanisms, such as self-audits, are justified.<br /><br />For example, agencies <strong>should</strong> establish procedures to ensure compliance with redisclosure limitations. One mechanism for assuring compliance would be to have the recipient agency certify on a periodic basis that it has examined practices regarding redisclosure and, if necessary, taken corrective action where improper redisclosures have occurred.<br /><br />8. Privacy Impact Assessments.<br />In the President's FY2001 budget, the President announced an initiative to make "privacy impact assessments," or "PIAs," a regular part of the development of new Government computer systems. A PIA is a plan to build privacy protection into new information systems, such as, for example, by asking systems personnel and program personnel to work through questions on data needs and data protection before the system is developed. The CIO Council has voted the IRS PIA a best practice; it is available as a reference at http://www.cio.gov.</p>
