<p>In addition to ensuring PMs are appropriately qualified, this quarter's e-Gov management scorecard requires agencies to submit to OMB by July 30th, a plan to meet (i.e., implement and achieve) the CIO Council guidance [issued in the FY 2005 Budget Guidance]. Your plans <strong>should</strong> document your approach, milestones and schedule for meeting budget guidance. Further, the plans <strong>should</strong> be coordinated with your Chief Human Capital Officers, please follow OPMï¿½s Workforce Planning Model (www.opm.gov/workforceplanning/) and the OPM Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (http://apps.opm.gov/HumanCapital/tool/index.cfm). <strong>Complete</strong> the attached summary table as part of your plan.</p>

<p>For the FY 2006 budget submission, agencies <strong>should</strong> use section I.D. of budget exhibit 300 to identify the required PM Level for each investment (e.g., does the project require a Level 1, 2 or 3 PM), and whether the assigned PM's qualifications have been validated against the CIO Council guidance. If the PM is in the process of being validated, or cannot be validated at the appropriate project level at this time, you <strong>should</strong> explain how (e.g., training, mentoring) and when the validation will be completed.</p>
