<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Potential Benefits of Prizes</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Administration believes that prizes and challenges have a number of potential benefits. Under the right circumstances, they may allow government to: <br />Establish an important goal without having to choose the approach or the team that is most likely to succeed; Pay only for results; Highlight excellence in particular domain of human endeavor to motivate, inspire, and guide others; Increase the number and diversity of the individuals, organizations, and teams that are addressing a particular problem or challenge of national or international significance; <br />Improve the skills of the participants in the competition; Stimulate private sector investment that is many times greater than the cash value of the prize; <br />Further a Federal agency's mission by attracting more interest and  attention to a defined program, activity, or issue of concern, and Capture the public imagination and change the public's perception of what is possible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <strong>encourage</strong> agencies to: <br />Identify and proactively address legal, regulatory, technical, and other barriers to the use of prizes and challenges;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <strong>encourage</strong> agencies to: <br />Select one or more individuals to identify and implement prizes and challenges, potentially in partnership with outside organizations, and to participate in a government- wide �community of practice� led by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <strong>encourage</strong> agencies to: <br />Increase their capacity to support, design, and manage prizes, potentially in collaboration with external partners.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To support agencies in the execution of prizes that further the policy objectives of the Federal Government, the Administration <strong>will</strong> make available a web-based platform for prizes and challenges within 120 days. This platform <strong>will</strong> provide a forum for agencies to post problems and invite communities of problem solvers to suggest, collaborate on, and deliver solutions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Over the longer term, the General Services Administration (GSA) <strong>will</strong> also provide government-wide services to share best practices and assist agencies in developing guidelines for issuing challenges.  Additionally, GSA <strong>will</strong> develop, as expeditiously as possible, a contract vehicle to provide agency access to relevant products and services, including technical assistance in structuring and conducting contests to take maximum benefit of the marketplace as they identify and pursue contest initiatives to further the policy objectives of the Federal Government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In considering the use of prizes and challenges, agencies <strong>should</strong> have a clear idea of what they are trying to accomplish by supporting or encouraging the creation of a prize, and how the prize will help them achieve that goal. A prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring private innovation and change. Furthermore, agencies <strong>should</strong> plan appropriately for all stages of prize development and, where permissible, consider partnering with other entities that might administer, support, or catalyze the prize.</p>

<p class='context'>Use of Prizes and Challenges � Policy Issues for Consideration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In considering the use of prizes and challenges, agencies <strong>should</strong> have a clear idea of what they are trying to accomplish by supporting or encouraging the creation of a prize, and how the prize will help them achieve that goal.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Choose the Right Prize for the Goal</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exemplar prizes, such as the Nobel Prize, define excellence within an area. Historically, most prizes have been exemplar prizes that recognize past general achievement in a field, but other prize designs may more effectively spur future innovation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Point solution prizes aim to reward and spur development of solutions for a particular, well-defined problem. NASA, for example, is using an online �innovation marketplace� with 180,000 participants to spur solutions to problems such as forecasting solar activity, keeping food fresh in space, and developing a compact aerobic device for astronauts. An advance market commitment may be one vehicle for spurring specific solutions by providing a commitment to purchase a product that does not yet exist. In the private sector, for example, five governments and the Gates Foundation have pledged $1.5 billion to support the purchase of pneumococcal vaccines for children in developing countries, which could save the lives of 7 million children by 2030.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exposition prizes help identify and promote a broad range of promising ideas and practices that may not otherwise attract attention, facilitating further development of the idea or practice by third parties. Successful exposition prizes can mobilize capital and institutions in support of ideas and practices developed during a prize competition. For example, the Director of National Intelligence sponsors the Galileo Award to encourage Federal employees to propose creative solutions for the Intelligence Community, and provides winners with a cash prize and the opportunity to brief senior officials on their ideas.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Network prizes build networks and strengthen communities by organizing winners into new problem-solving communities that can deliver more impact than individual efforts. One example would be a contest encouraging people worldwide to share their thoughts and ideas on a variety of topics of universal interest and then organizing participants into an active online community, creating a global, cross-cultural dialogue in furtherance of the public diplomacy mission of the United States.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Participation prizes create value during and after the competition � not through conferral of the prize award itself but through their role in encouraging contestants to change their behavior or develop new skills that may have beneficial effects during and beyond the competition. As part of his �Educate to Innovate� campaign, for example, President Obama has highlighted the FIRST robotics competitions, which engage over 200,000 students, and are designed to motivate young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. A contest encouraging good nutrition on the part of school cafeterias or school children would be an example of a participation prize; contestants participate not necessarily to collect the reward, but for the fun and benefits of the competition itself.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Market stimulation prizes try to establish the viability of a market to address a potential market failure, mobilize additional human talent and financial capital to jumpstart the development of a new industry, or change public perceptions about what is possible. The goal of the Ansari X Prize, for example, was to serve as a catalyst for the private spaceflight industry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Focus on All Stages of the Prize, including Pre-Prize and Post-Prize Stages</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> plan appropriately for all stages of prize development and administration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies also <strong>should</strong> plan for the post-prize phase, reinforcing the impact of an award with other investments and follow-up activities.  In some cases, it may be helpful and appropriate to increase the visibility of a prize by involving senior agency officials in the launch.  It may be further helpful in some instances for an agency to identify government actions that would increase the impact of the prize over the long-term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Choose the Right Vehicles and Partners for the Prize</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> think broadly about the role that effective partners can play in administering or publicizing contests.  It may be appropriate, where legally permissible, to seek Federal agency or non-federal partners to help meet agency goals.  Some or all of the following vehicles may, in appropriate circumstances, be worthy of consideration: Designing, administering, and paying for the prize internally within the agency; Providing a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract to an outside organization that covers some or all of the costs associated with the prize purse and prize administration; or Encouraging the formation of a public-private partnership to fund and administer a prize.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Potential Legal Authority � Issues for Consideration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies considering prizes and competitions <strong>should</strong> consult with their general counsels concerning legal issues relevant to their agencies and to ensure that each use of a prize or competition is consistent with congressional authorization or appropriation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Grants and Cooperative Agreements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some agencies have authority to award grants and/or participate in cooperative agreements and may be able conduct prize competitions though that authority. A �grant� is defined in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (and in OMB Circulars) as financial assistance by the Federal Government that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose; a �cooperative agreement� is similarly defined, with the additional criterion that the agency expects to have substantial involvement with the recipient in carrying out the activities contemplated in the agreement. Neither instrument may be used to acquire goods or services for the direct use or benefit of the Federal Government, such as to conduct an agency�s own prize contest; agencies <strong>must</strong> use procurement contracts for that purpose.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, where grants or cooperative agreements are appropriate mechanisms under a given statute to distribute funds, then a �cash prize for a competition� <strong>could</strong> potentially also be a type of grant or the subject of a cooperative agreement that <strong>could</strong> be used if otherwise consistent with the specific authorizing statute for the grant.  Discretionary, competitive grant programs (in contrast to formula grants or block grants) may be best suited as vehicles for prize competitions, since discretionary, competitive grants are often authorized by statutes that do not specify the manner in which grant funds must be distributed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As part of their consideration of using grants to facilitate prize competitions, agencies <strong>may</strong> examine their authority to make fixed obligation awards without requirements for Federal monitoring of actual costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Necessary Expense Doctrine</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An agency without explicit prize authority might be able to conduct a contest and/or offer a prize if doing so bears a direct relationship to the agency�s statutorily authorized mission.  Agencies <strong>should</strong> consult their general counsels to determine whether such a relationship exists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Under the �necessary expense� doctrine, an agency <strong>has</strong> reasonable discretion in determining how to carry out the objects of an appropriation. To qualify as a �necessary expense,� the expenditure must:  <br />(1) <strong>make</strong> a direct contribution to carrying out either a specific appropriation or an authorized agency function for which more general appropriations are available; <br />(2) not be prohibited by law; and (3) not be an item that falls within the scope of some other appropriation or statutory funding scheme.  <br /><br />See <a href="#not-implemented">Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 4-19 to 4- 29, 4-162 to 4-164</a> (discussing Comptroller General�s view of the �necessary expense� doctrine and government-sponsored contests).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> have increased latitude to offer cash prizes in competitions that involve artistic design.  See <a href="#not-implemented">Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 4-162 to 4-164.</a> Any prize purse awarded must be related to the reasonable cost of producing the design. See id.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Authority to Provide Non-Monetary Support to Prize Competitions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> have statutory authorities in areas such as public education, outreach, and the like that can serve as a basis for supporting prize competitions without providing funds.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> be able to conduct a procurement in a contest-like manner to encourage greater innovation and private sector participation, when the payment of a prize is for a good or service for the benefit of the government.   Where appropriate, an agency could thus use existing procurement authority, such as that provided by the <a href="#not-implemented">Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Chapter 1)</a>, to issue a solicitation seeking offers that would have to meet certain technical criteria � essentially the rules of the contest � for which the agency would pay a fixed amount (the prize).  In situations where small monetary prizes or small procurements are considered (in particular, below the $100,000 simplified acquisition procedure threshold), agencies might also be able to leverage the flexibilities afforded by simplified acquisition procedures to allow for innovative, contest-based approaches to such procurements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In addition, a contractor <strong>may</strong> be able to conduct a prize competition among sub- contractors to encourage innovative means of satisfying the contract and achieving the agency�s procurement needs.  Agencies <strong>should</strong> work with their Office of General Counsel and procurement officials to structure competitions that are compliant with applicable rules and regulations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Other Transactions Authority</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some agencies are authorized to enter into �other transactions� (OTs), which may provide those agencies with the flexibility to structure prize competitions that draw in entities that do not traditionally do business with the Federal Government or to leverage private sector funding.  These authorities differ by agency, so those agencies that possess OT authority <strong>should</strong> consult their general counsels and examine their specific implementing regulations and guidance documents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies with OT authority <strong>should</strong> work with their Offices of General Counsel to determine whether this authority would be beneficial in structuring competitions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Partnership Authority</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies may have statutory authority to form partnerships with other agencies. See, e.g., <a href="#not-implemented">49 U.S.C. � 106(l)(6), 106(m)</a> (providing FAA with the authority to enter into �other transactions� with and to accept �services, equipment, personnel, and facilities� from other Federal agencies).  Such authority may prove useful to agencies that want to further their statutory missions by working with or supporting other agencies� prize endeavors. If contemplating such a partnership, an agency <strong>should</strong> be sure to consult with its Office of General Counsel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Public-Private Partnership Authority</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies may have authority to partner with outside entities such as foundations and nonprofit organizations that may elect to award cash prizes or other forms of recognition directly to the winners of government prize competitions.  A supplemental award from the private sector can increase the incentives for participation in a competition. An agency considering such partnerships <strong>should</strong> consult with its Office of General Counsel, and <strong>should</strong> specifically consider issues relating to its solicitation or gift acceptance authorities to ensure compliance with the rule against augmenting appropriations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='context'>Other Prize-Related Legal Issues</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>FACA Compliance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> be sure to comply with <a href="#not-implemented">FACA</a>�s requirements, where applicable, when establishing a method of selecting a prize or contest winner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Ethical Issues and Federal Endorsement of Products or Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Federal employees <strong>must</strong> comply with the <a href="#not-implemented">Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. Part 2635</a>, and the general principle that employees will act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.   Any competition, challenge, or contest run by or with the involvement of a Federal agency <strong>must</strong> be run so as to ensure participants are treated equally and there is no conflict of interest, or appearance of a conflict, on the part of the contest judges or administrators.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Moreover, agencies <strong>should</strong> avoid any improper Federal endorsement of products or services when creating contests and prizes.  See 5 <a href="#not-implemented">C.F.R. 2635.702(c)</a>.  Federal endorsement is not improper when it is �[i]n furtherance of statutory authority to promote products, services or enterprises� or �[a]s a result of documentation of compliance with agency requirements or standards or as the result of recognition for achievement given under an agency program of recognition for accomplishment in support of the agency�s mission.�  Id. Thus, agencies contemplating contests or prizes that could lead to the appearance of Federal endorsement <strong>should</strong> examine their statutory authorities to determine if they have authority to promote products, services, or enterprises, or whether the contest or prize is offered �in support of� their statutory mission.  Agencies <strong>should</strong> consult with their Offices of General Counsel on avoiding conflicts of interest and engaging in or permitting Federal endorsement, or the appearance thereof, in connection with government contests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Intellectual Property</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> carefully consider whether a competition will involve intellectual property and determine in advance how to assign the rights to such works between themselves and the winning contestants.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> consult with their general counsels in determining how to assign intellectual property rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Compliance with State Law</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> evaluate the need for potential contests and prizes to comply with varying state laws.  To the extent that state laws apply to a Federal prize competition at all, be aware that states generally regulate contests of chance much more heavily than they do contests of skill, and that injecting any element of chance into the selection of a contest or prize winner may significantly alter the state legal requirements with which the agency must comply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Standard Requirements for Procurement Contracts, Grants, and Cooperative Agreements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies that enter into procurement contracts, issue grants, or enter into cooperative agreements regarding prize competitions <strong>should</strong> consider standard requirements for documentation, reporting, and audits, and the <a href="#not-implemented">Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. � 200 et seq.)</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Depending on the objectives, types, and sizes of prize competitions to be awarded, agencies <strong>may</strong> be able to modify the standard requirements to better match the administration and purposes of these awards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> consider applying all standard requirements pertaining to pre-award and audit requirements, and modifying � to the extent allowable by law � the requirements for post-award requirements and compliance with the OMB cost principles.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> modify the post-award and cost compliance requirements with respect to program income and financial reporting.  This could include, for purposes of illustration and when legally allowable, a waiver of the requirement for recipients to file a final financial report since the awards are for fixed amounts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> also opt not to apply OMB cost principles since the prize awards are pre-determined and not based on costs.  Exceptions to standard requirements should be made on a case by case basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Paperwork Reduction Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> evaluate the applicability of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to any prize-related activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As a general matter, if an agency is directing identical questions to, or imposing identical recordkeeping requirements on, ten or more persons, then such an information collection is subject to the <a href="#not-implemented">PRA (44 U.S.C. � 3501 et seq.</a>; <a href="#not-implemented">5 C.F.R. Part 1320).</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An agency is, however, permitted to <strong>ask</strong> the general public about ideas for improving current practices, and these general requests do not become subject to the PRA merely because they take the form of a contest, or because the agency announces that it will give a prize to those with the best ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Privacy Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> evaluate the applicability of the Privacy Act to any prize-related activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
