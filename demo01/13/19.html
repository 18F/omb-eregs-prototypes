<p class='context'>Reporting Security Incidents</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This memorandum <strong>revises</strong> those reporting procedures to now require agencies to report all incidents involving personally identifiable information to US-CERT within one hour of discovering the incident. You should report all incidents involving personally identifiable information in electronic or physical form and should not distinguish between suspected and confirmed breaches. US-CERT will forward all agency reports to the appropriate Identity Theft Task Force point-of-contact also within one hour of notification by an agency.</p>

<p>In addition, please <strong>provide</strong> additional detail on how you are allocating your resources between correcting existing security weaknesses in stead-state investments and proposing funds for system development, modernization, or enhancement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Finally, for those agencies having significant isolated or wide-spread weaknesses identified by the agency Inspector General or the Government Accountability Office, please <strong>identify</strong> the specific funds you are requesting for proposed development, modernization, or enhancement efforts to correct these security weaknesses. This includes correcting weaknesses found during your privacy program reviews required by OMB Memorandum <a href="#not-implemented">M-06-15</a>, �Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information� and for implementing the specific security controls set forth in OMB Memorandum <a href="#not-implemented">M-06-16</a>, �Protection of Sensitive Agency Information.�</p>
