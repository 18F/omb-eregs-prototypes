<p class='context'>25 Point Implementation Plan To Reform Federal Information Technology Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. Apply �Light Technology� and Shared Solutions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> focus on consolidating existing data centers, reducing the need for infrastructure growth by implementing a �Cloud First� policy for services, and increasing their use of available cloud and shared services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.1 Identify agency data center program managers to lead consolidation efforts</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, each agency <strong>will</strong> designate a senior, dedicated data center consolidation program manager with project management experience and technical competence in IT infrastructure. Because data center consolidation requires interactions with many stakeholder groups, the data center program manager <strong>must</strong> also have strong communication skills. The data center program manager at each agency <strong>will</strong> be responsible for developing a plan with interim, verifiable milestones to reach the agency�s data center reduction target and monitor progress toward those goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.2  Launch a Data Center Consolidation Task Force to ensure successful execution</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next three months, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> launch a government-wide Data Center Consolidation Task Force comprised of the data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force <strong>will</strong> be responsible for working together to share progress toward individual agency goals and the overall Federal target of a minimum of 800 data center closures by 2015. The Data Center Consolidation Task Force <strong>will</strong> meet monthly to review progress of each consolidation project and ensure government-wide alignment between agency efforts where appropriate. The Task Force <strong>will</strong> serve as a �community of practice� for Agency CIOs and data center program managers to share best practices from this effort and enhance consolidation effectiveness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.3  Launch a publicly available dashboard to track data center consolidation progress</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB <strong>will</strong> launch a publicly available dashboard to serve as a window into progress of the data center consolidation program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2. Create a government-wide marketplace for data center availability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next 18 months, OMB and GSA <strong>will</strong> create a government-wide marketplace that better utilizes<br />spare capacity within operational data centers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3. Shift to a �Cloud First� policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning immediately, the Federal Government <strong>will</strong> shift to a "Cloud First" policy. The three-part strategy on cloud technology <strong>will</strong> revolve around using commercial could where feasible, launching private government clouds, and utilizing regional clouds with state and local governments where appropriate.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When evaluating options for new IT deployments, OMB <strong>will require</strong> that agencies default to cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable, cost-effective cloud option exists. To facilitate this shift, we will be standing up secure government-wide cloud computing platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.1 Publish cloud strategy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> publish a strategy to accelerate the safe and secure adoption of cloud computing across the government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <strong>will</strong> facilitate and lead the development of standards for security, interoperability, and portability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3.2 Jump-start the migration to cloud technologies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Agency CIO <strong>will</strong> be required to identify three �<strong>must</strong> move� services and create a project plan for migrating each of them to cloud solutions and retiring the associated legacy systems. Of the three, at least one of the services <strong>must</strong> fully migrate to a cloud solution within 12 months and the remaining two within 18 months. Each migration plan <strong>will</strong> include major milestones, execution risks, adoption targets, and required resources, as well as a retirement plan for legacy services once cloud services are online. These new cloud implementations <strong>should</strong> be compatible with the secure, certified platforms currently provided in the private sector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4. Stand-up contract vehicles for secure IaaS solutions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, after completing security certification, GSA <strong>will</strong> make a common set of contract vehicles for cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions available government-wide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>5. Stand-up contract vehicles for commodity services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months, GSA <strong>will</strong> utilize [the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) E-mail Working Group] requirements to stand up government-wide contract vehicles for cloud-based email solutions. GSA <strong>will</strong> also begin a similar process specifically designed for other back-end, cloud-based solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>6. Develop a strategy for shared services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next 12 months, the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> develop a strategy for shared services. That strategy <strong>will</strong> build on earlier Federal Government successes in shared services and include benchmarks on current usage and uptake rates, as well as service level agreements (SLAs), customer satisfaction levels, costs, and overall economic effectiveness.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Managing partners of shared services <strong>will</strong> assess the current state of shared services and each release a roadmap to improve quality and uptake. Ultimately, the managing partners <strong>will</strong> be responsible for executing these roadmaps and <strong>will</strong> be held accountable for improvements on SLAs and reductions in cost. These efforts <strong>will</strong> enable the current shared services to be accessible government-wide at higher quality levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>PART II: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING LARGE-SCALE IT PROGRAMS</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Moving forward, Federal IT programs <strong>must</strong> be structured to deploy working business functionality in release cycles no longer than 12 months, and, ideally, less than six months, with initial deployment to end users no later than 18 months after the program begins.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Program managers <strong>need to</strong> define each phase of the IT development lifecycle and rigorously manage scope. These timelines <strong>should</strong> encompass the entire process -- from concept through requirement analysis, development, test, and delivery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>B. Strengthen Program Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>7. Design a formal IT program management career path</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the next six months, OPM, with input from agencies and OMB, <strong>will</strong> create a specialized career path for IT program managers (PMs). This <strong>will</strong> likely require creating a separate Occupational Series specific to IT program management within the current IT family with career advancement paths that are more competitive with the private sector. The path <strong>should</strong> require expertise and experience for advancement. It <strong>will</strong> also require the development of a competency model for IT program management consistent with the IT project manager model. [...] In the next six months, OPM <strong>will</strong> work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for IT PMs as necessary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the next six months, OPM <strong>will</strong> work with OMB to provide agencies with direct hiring authority for IT PMs as necessary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] agencies <strong>will</strong> identify specific IT program management competency gaps in the next Human Capital Management Report and develop specific plans to close the IT PM gap. To ensure that agencies are executing these plans, senior agency executives <strong>will</strong> review their progress and provide an interim report to OMB, 12 months after the next Human Capital Management Report is published.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OPM <strong>will</strong> work with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pilot the IT program management career track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>8. Scale IT program management career path government-wide</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>After piloting IT program management career paths at Treasury and USDA, OPM <strong>will</strong> work to expand the IT program management career paths more broadly across the Federal Government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>9. Require integrated program teams</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next six months, OMB <strong>will</strong> issue guidance requiring an IPT [Integrated Program Teams], led by a dedicated, full-time program manager and supported by an IT acquisition specialist, be in place for all major IT programs before OMB <strong>will</strong> approve program budgets.[...] For major IT investments, agency leadership <strong>will</strong> approve the composition of the integrated program team and the dedicated program manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>9.1 Dedicate resources throughout the program lifecycle and co-locate when possible</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For each large IT program, critical members of the IPT [Integrated Project Team] <strong>will</strong> serve as full-time resources dedicated to the program. This <strong>must</strong> include a 100% dedicated IT program manager, but other roles <strong>will</strong> vary by program. Key members of the IPT <strong>will</strong> also be co-located during the most critical junctures of the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>9.2 Agencies will hold integrated program team members accountable for both individual functional goals and overall program success</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agency executives <strong>will</strong> work with their senior procurement executives (SPEs), CIOs, and program leaders to take action and drive towards a more balanced set of individual and program success metrics based on the following two recommendations:<br />� First, agencies <strong>should</strong> set up individual performance goals that cover individual and program objectives. Performance goals for acquisition, IT, and business personnel <strong>need to</strong> include a combination of individual and program objectives.<br />� Second, agencies <strong>must</strong> also ensure that the individual and program metrics balance speed, quality, effectiveness, and compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations. Supervisors <strong>must</strong> utilize a balanced set of performance metrics to evaluate individual performance. Individuals who provide exemplary contributions to the team <strong>will</strong> be recognized for their success (e.g., acquisition recognition through the Federal Acquisition Institute Awards & Recognition Program for individuals who effectively meet program needs without sacrificing compliance).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>10. Launch a best practices collaboration platform</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within six months, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> develop a collaboration portal to exchange best practices, case studies, and allow for real-time problem solving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>11. Launch technology fellows program</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months, the office of the Federal CIO <strong>will</strong> create a technology fellows program and the accompanying recruiting infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>12. Enable IT program manager mobility across government and industry</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal CIO Council, OMB, and OPM, over the next 12 � 18 months, <strong>will be</strong> responsible for developing a process that will support and encourage movement of program managers across government and industry.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal CIO Council, OMB, and OPM <strong>will</strong> work to design opportunities for industry rotation to allow Federal program managers to remain up-to-date with the latest skills while managing conflict of interest issues.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To support PM mobility, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> build a repository of information on all Federal Government IT PMs, including relevant background, specific expertise, implementation experience, and performance as part of its best practices collaboration platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>C1. Align the Acquisition Process with the Technology Cycle</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>13. Design and develop a cadre of specialized IT acquisition professionals</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next six months, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the Federal CIO, with input from agencies, <strong>will</strong> design a specialized IT acquisition cadre.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>13.1 Strengthen IT acquisition skills and capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within six months, OFPP, with input from agencies, <strong>will</strong> develop guidance on requirements for IT acquisition specialists. In addition, OFPP <strong>will</strong> develop guidance on curriculum standards to cross-train program managers and IT acquisition professionals.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In particular, the guidance [issued by OFPP] <strong>will</strong> focus on increasing cross-functional knowledge of the IT marketplace, IT program management, and IT acquisition. OFPP <strong>will</strong> build upon its current Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) to develop a path for IT expertise. OFPP <strong>will</strong> leverage existing curriculum that may exist within agencies that already host specialized IT acquisition professionals. Skills development <strong>will</strong> include:<br />� Classroom training: OFPP <strong>will</strong> leverage and strengthen, where necessary, existing classes at the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), and engage these and other training providers to develop additional offerings as necessary.<br />� On-the-job experience: As is true with acquisition in general, the skills needed to successfully handle large IT acquisitions call for a blend of classroom training and on-the-job experience. For example, contracting professionals with hands-on IT experience are better equipped to help IT and program staff translate business and technical requirements into a statement of work that can help ensure a smooth procurement.<br />� Mentorship: Building a strong culture of mentorship enables IT acquisition professionals to more quickly learn �the art of the possible� to deliver effective IT acquisition solutions. OFPP can encourage this by building on FAI�s ongoing efforts to foster mentorship and networking opportunities, within and between agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As an immediate action to implement these recommendations, OFPP <strong>will</strong> consider these initiatives as part of its review of the Federal Acquisition Certifications for Program/Project Managers (P/PMs), Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTR), and contracting professionals in the next six months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>14. Identify IT acquisition best practices and adopt government-wide</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OFPP <strong>will</strong> lead an effort over the next six months to study the experience of those agencies that have already created specialized IT acquisition teams, in order to develop a model to scale more broadly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] OFPP <strong>should</strong> work closely with senior agency leadership at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy (DOE) as they rollout their IT acquisition cadres in the next year. The next step, over the following 18 months, <strong>is</strong> to scale the specialized IT acquisition cadre government-wide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>15. Issue contracting guidance and templates to support modular development</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next year, OFPP <strong>will</strong> work with the acquisition and IT communities to develop guidance on contracting for modular development. As part of this effort, OFPP <strong>will</strong> hold an open meeting with industry leaders to solicit ideas/feedback on contracting for modular development. OFPP <strong>will</strong> develop templates and samples, and <strong>will</strong> create communities of practice to facilitate adoption of modular contracting practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>16. Reduce barriers to entry for small innovative technology companies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of this effort, and to enable small IT companies to work with the Federal Government, SBA, GSA, and OFPP <strong>will</strong> take concrete steps over the next 18 months to develop clearer and more comprehensive small business contracting policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>C2. Align the Budget Process with the Technology Cycle</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>17.1 Analyze working capital funds and transfer authorities to identify current IT budget flexibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next six months, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with Congress to analyze existing working capital funds (WCFs) and other vehicles for pooling funds and extending availability of funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>17.2  Identify programs for which to pilot flexible budget models</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within six months, Agency CIOs and CFOs <strong>will</strong> identify programs at several agencies for which added budget flexibility could save money and improve outcomes. OMB and agencies <strong>will</strong> work with Congress to develop proposed budget models to complement the modular development approach. In addition, OMB and agencies <strong>will</strong> evaluate mechanisms for increased transparency for these programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>18. Develop supporting materials and guidance for flexible IT budget models</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to support agencies and appropriations staff in leveraging budget flexibility, the Federal CFO Council, in collaboration with the Federal CIO Council, <strong>will</strong> develop a set of best practices and materials that explain the need for these types of funding, and prescribe a path to achieving more flexible models. <br />As a first step, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> create a segmentation of common IT program types and the associated funding requirements. The Federal CFO Council <strong>will</strong> then work with the Federal CIO Council to create detailed �playbooks� mapping each IT program type to specific budget vehicles based on examples of past investments and IT needs (e.g., multi-year funding for programs with several discrete deliverables).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal CFO and CIO Councils <strong>will</strong> create a set of guidelines for increasing transparency in the utilization of IT funds. Agencies <strong>will</strong> follow these guidelines and institute additional review processes for multi-year funds and portfolio funding to prevent mismanagement of increased funding flexibility (e.g., masking program delays or overruns).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 1.41] Agencies <strong>will</strong> follow these guidelines and institute additional review processes for multi-year funds and portfolio funding to prevent mismanagement of increased funding flexibility (e.g., masking program delays or overruns).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>19. Work with Congress to scale flexible IT budget models more broadly</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months, OMB <strong>will</strong> engage several agencies to work with Congress to launch flexible IT budget models where appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>20. Work with Congress to consolidate commodity IT spending under Agency CIO</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next six months, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with Congress to develop a workable funding model for �commodity� IT services. These funding models <strong>will</strong> be applicable to both inter-agency IT services and intra-agency IT services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 1.44] On an annual basis, the Agency CIOs and the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> identify �commodity� services to be included in this funding model as they are migrated towards shared services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>D. Streamline Governance and Improve Accountability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>21.1. Revamp IT Budget Submissions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By May of 2011, OMB <strong>will</strong> reconstruct the 300s and 53s [�] The timing of these elements <strong>will</strong> be separated into distinct streams to clarify objectives, give agencies adequate time to assemble strong responses, and improve data quality. These streams <strong>will</strong> include:<br />� Budget justification for new major Development, Modernization and Enhancement (DME) investments, significant re-engineering of existing DME investments, and annual re-justification of DME investments.<br />� Health monitoring of existing DME investments and Operations and Maintenance (O&M)<br />� Portfolio governance to ensure the IT portfolio and individual projects are consistent with the agency mission and Federal policy objectives</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Importantly, OMB and agencies <strong>must</strong> evaluate the way in which IT programs are reviewed so that budget approval for large IT programs is tied to key implementation steps rather than seemingly upfront, wholesale approval of massive programs.� OMB <strong>will</strong> evaluate ways to ensure agencies can demonstrate strong performance in earlier modules in order to receive approval for funding of subsequent modules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>21. Reform and strengthen Investment Review Boards</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By March 2011, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with Agency CIOs and other agency leaders to stand up the �TechStat� model at the departmental level. Steps include<br />� OMB <strong>will</strong> assist agencies in designing tools and enforcing their use, to provide the transparency required for the �TechStat� model to be effective.<br />� OMB analysts <strong>will</strong> provide in-person training to Agency CIOs in �TechStat� methodology including accountability guidelines, engagement cadence, evaluation processes, and reporting processes.<br />� Agency leaders <strong>will</strong> lead, sponsor, and manage the process within their departments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>22. Redefine role of Agency CIOs and Federal CIO Council</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agency CIOs <strong>will</strong> be responsible for managing the portfolio of large IT projects within their agencies. This portfolio management role <strong>will</strong> include continuously identifying unmet needs to be addressed by new projects, terminating or turning around poorly performing projects, and retiring IT investments which no longer meet the needs of the organization. Steps <strong>will</strong> include:<br />� As described above, Agency CIOs <strong>will</strong> take on responsibility for the �TechStat� governance process within their agencies as of March 2011.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> turnaround or terminate at least one-third of poorly performing projects in their portfolio within the next 18 months. The Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> play a similar portfolio management role, but at a cross-agency level. Within six months, the Federal CIO Council <strong>will</strong> periodically review the highest priority �TechStat� findings assembled by the Agency CIOs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>23. Rollout �TechStat� model at bureau-level</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Once cemented at the agency level, the "TechStat" model <strong>will</strong> be deployed at the bureau-level to ensure the effective management of large programs. Within 18 months, Agency CIOs, in collaboration with other agency leaders, <strong>will</strong> be responsible for deploying the tools and training necessary to ensure rollout has been completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>E. Increase Engagement with Industry</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>24. Launch �myth-busters� education campaign</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OFPP <strong>will</strong> identify the major myths that most significantly hinder requirements definition and the development of effective acquisition planning and execution. In January 2011, OFPP <strong>will</strong> issue a memorandum identifying these myths and the related facts and strategies to improve constructive engagement. This effort <strong>will</strong> be supported through discussions and other outreach efforts with key stakeholders in early 2011 including, but not limited to:<br />� Professional associations and other industry representatives.<br />� Federal stakeholders including program managers, contracting professionals, agency attorneys, and ethics officials.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Throughout 2011, the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and OFPP <strong>will</strong> conduct a �myth-buster� awareness campaign to eliminate artificial private sector engagement barriers. Steps <strong>will</strong> include at least the following:<br />� Launch an online community of practice within the next six months using technologies such as video channels to provide a Q&A forum, celebrate successes, and share �myths� and potential �myth-busters�<br />� Conduct FAI webinar for the acquisition workforce hosted by OFPP by late January 2011<br />� Create mandatory, continuous learning program through the FAI website<br />� Present at conferences such as the GSA Expo, the National Contract Management Association (NCMA) World Conference, and NCMA Government Contract Management Conference throughout 2011.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>25. Launch interactive platform for pre-RFP agency-industry collaboration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Inexpensive, efficient solutions such as these <strong>should be</strong> made available to all agencies to effectively tap the understanding of industry partners, especially in the period prior to issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP). Within the next six months, GSA <strong>will</strong> launch a government-wide, online, interactive platform for this purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>A. Apply �Light Technology� and Shared Solutions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>2. Create a government-wide marketplace for data center availability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the next 18 months, OMB and GSA <strong>will</strong> create a government-wide marketplace that better utilizes spare capacity within operational data centers.

<p class='context'>Section 55 - Information Technology Investments</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>55.1 Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> submit information on their respective information technology (IT) investment portfolios, using the required formats, as applicable, as stated in the FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance. This section provides general guidance related to reporting on IT and the templates used to collect that information. Section 25.5 provides electronic links to the definitions and specific reporting instructions and exhibits related to budgeting for investments in IT.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Strengthening IT Portfolio Management is a continued focus and commitment to assess the effectiveness of current IT management practices and to address opportunities to improve management of IT resources. Authoritative data is key to providing the ability of IT and business leaders to have data-driven discussions about cost and value of IT to best support business goals. As a Government, we <strong>will</strong> be exploring the adoption of standardized methodologies for IT costing, geared effectively and consistently (using a data-driven agreed upon framework), communicating the cost of IT, and also attributing that cost to business services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Updates to this section lay a path for additional changes planned:<br />� New standard commodity IT Infrastructure and IT Management investments. This year, two standard investments <strong>are</strong> being introduced: IT Security & Compliance (major) and IT Management (non-major). The intent is to identify additional standard investments, against which all agencies will report, to enable Government-wide comparisons and improved benchmarking metrics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.2 Why must I report on information technology investments?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the budget process, OMB is <strong>required</strong> to develop and oversee a process for IT budgeting and portfolio management, with a detailed focus on all major capital investments, to include �analyzing, tracking, and evaluating the risks, including information security risks, and results of all major capital investments made by an executive agency for information systems�. <a href="#not-implemented">40 U.S.C. � 11302</a>. OMB also is <strong>responsible</strong> for IT Portfolio oversight (<a href="#not-implemented">44 U.S.C. � 3602</a>), i.e. the use of information technologies to enhance access of information and delivery of services; and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation of government operations.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> provide required data on total IT funding using the formats specified in the <a href="#not-implemented">FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance</a>. IT funding information <strong>should</strong> be consistent with the overall agency budget submission (see section 51.19), and your agency�s enterprise architecture (EA), Agency IT Portfolio Summary components, and Major IT Business Case submissions. IT investment costs <strong>must</strong> include funding from all Federal budgetary resources (e.g., direct appropriation, collections, transfers, and unobligated balances).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.3 - What specific guidance applies to FY 2017, and when is the information required?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Submissions <strong>should</strong> be consistent with OMB Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Guidance. The IT Portfolio Summary <strong>is required</strong> to be submitted to OMB the same day in September, or within one week, of your Agency�s current services baseline budget submission. Timing details on the Major Business Cases are outlined in the <a href="#not-implemented">FY 2018 IT Budget � Capital Planning Guidance</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Additional updates to the Agency IT Portfolio Summary and Agency Major IT Business Cases <strong>may</strong> be applicable after final budget release in order to reflect changes in funding levels due to enactment of appropriations. Specific instructions and deadlines for submitting updates, corrections, and final submissions of exhibits will be available on the OMB MAX Federal Community.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the <a href="#not-implemented">Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (Pub. L. No. 113�291)</a> and related OMB guidance, Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), and budget officers <strong>must</strong> coordinate to ensure that IT budget data is consistent with the agency�s budget submission, and <strong>must</strong> complete �IT Resources Statements� described in section 51.3.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For IT budget submission, agencies <strong>may</strong> submit fluctuations within IT investments and the IT portfolio between FY 2017 and FY 2018, as long as these fluctuations are coordinated and consistent with the agency�s overall current services baseline. Within the budget process, agencies also <strong>must</strong>:<br />� ensure security of Federal information systems and data, while developing a continuous refresh and modernization process to secure information systems by design;<br />� account for regular software and product lifecycle refreshment;<br />� leverage best practices and lessons learned from other organizations to increase agility and flexibility in technology programs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OMB�s IT Category Management (ITCM) policies, <a href="#not-implemented">M-16-02, Category Management Policy 15-1</a>: Improving Acquisition and Management of Common Information Technology: Laptops and Desktops, and M-16-12 Category Management 16-1: Improving the Acquisition and Management of Common Information Technology: Software Licensing provide explicit guidance and targets for agencies that will impact how they formulate and execute their IT budgets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 3.28] As described in these policies, , agencies are <strong>required</strong> to follow ITCM policies and to ensure that the budgets incorporate the financial benefits as published by OMB. Agency IT budget submissions will be reviewed to ensure they are implementing these policies. Future guidance will include additional ITCM objectives.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The annual E-Gov MAX collection of information on expected agency contributions to E-Government and Line-of-Business initiatives for FY 2018 commenced in June 2016. This data collection for the FY 2018 budget reflects some important changes from prior years, including:]<br />� a requirement that by August 26, 2016, CFOs certify that required contribution levels are being included in the agency�s budget planning to OMB; and � each agency managing or contributing to E-Government and Line-of-Business</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.4 - How should agencies align IT investments with their strategic plans?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An agency�s IT investment management and reporting of IT investments <strong>must</strong> clearly demonstrate that each investment is needed to help meet the agency's strategic goals and mission and show how governance processes are used to plan, select, develop, implement, and operate those IT investments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] each IT investment <strong>should</strong> demonstrate the enabling and improvement of mission and program performance. Agencies demonstrate the IT Investment requirements and governance processes through Agency Major IT Business Cases, supporting documentation, Information Resources Management Strategic Plan, Enterprise Roadmap, and Agency IT Portfolio Summary submissions. The agency <strong>must</strong> further demonstrate how the investment supports a business line or enterprise service performance goal as documented in the agency�s enterprise architecture (EA), and annual Enterprise Roadmap submission to OMB. Documents used to manage the planning, development, implementation, and operation of IT investments and documents that demonstrate the outcomes of agency, branch, and bureau governance decisions <strong>should</strong> be maintained and made readily available if requested by OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency strategic planning <strong>should</strong> incorporate the requirement for regular software and product lifecycle refresh.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The individual agency's Agency IT Portfolio Summary submissions are used to create an overall "Federal IT Portfolio," which is published as part of the President's Budget. Agency and OMB portfolio reviews and Budget processes <strong>will ensure</strong> the selection of IT investments that support the agency�s strategic objectives or performance goals, as captured in the agency�s Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>55.6 What do I need to know about an agency's IT Budget and Management Requirements?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[The agency�s IT Budget and Management information is composed of two parts: ]<br />1) Agency IT Portfolio Summary � which includes:<br />a. Agency IT Investment Portfolio Summary - Includes IT investment budget, management, and architecture information, and the following Summary information:<br />b. Agency IT Provisioned Services Spending Summary - Includes IT investment budget and management information by cloud computing deployment model and service model;<br />c. Agency Data Center Spending Summary - Includes an Data Center spending summary for data center costs that the agency owns and operates; and<br />d. Budget Account Summary � Includes a summarized view of IT funding levels associated with budget accounts. This summary is derived from the Funding Sources table in the Agency IT Portfolio Summary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The agency�s IT Budget and Management information is composed of two parts: ]<br />2) Major IT Business Case - Includes detailed IT investment budget and management information for major IT investment</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency reporting of its IT Portfolio <strong>should</strong> include all of an agency�s annual IT costs. The agency�s complete IT portfolio <strong>must</strong> be reported, including all major, non-major, migration related, and funding contributions IT investments. For the FY 2018 budget submission, IT funding levels reported in the Agency IT Portfolio Summary <strong>should</strong> be consistent with your agency�s budget materials and <strong>should</strong> be categorized based upon the following four parts: <br />Category:<br />� Part 1 IT Investments for Mission Delivery<br />� Part 2 IT Investments for Administrative Services and Support Systems<br />� Part 3 IT Investments for Commodity IT Infrastructure and IT Management<br />� Part 4 IT Investments for Grants and Other Transferred Funding to Non-Federal Organizations for Information Technology.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Part 2 includes eGov/LoB and Unified Shared Services Management designated shared services. Previously required Part 4: Grants Management <strong>should</strong> be included in Part 2. Part 5: National Security Systems <strong>should</strong> be aligned against the appropriate Part above and will be delineated using investment type identifiers.<br /><br />Per section 51.3, your justification materials <strong>should</strong> include a section beginning with the words "IT Resource Statements" that provides the following: a statement from the CIO affirming that the CIO has reviewed and approved the major IT investments portion of your budget request; a statement from the CFO and CIO affirming that the CIO had a significant role in reviewing planned IT support for major program objectives and significant increases and decreases in IT resources; and a statement from the CIO and CFO that the IT Portfolio includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the budget request. If for any reason any of the above is not accurate, briefly describe the nature of the inaccuracy. The above statements and discussion <strong>must</strong> also be included in your agency's annual assurance statement described in <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-123</a>.</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>5. Definitions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A financial system, hereafter referred to as a core financial system, is an information system that may perform all financial functions including general ledger management, funds management, payment management, receivable management, and cost management. The core financial system is the system of record that maintains all transactions resulting from financial events. It may be integrated through a common database or interfaced electronically to meet defined data and processing requirements. The core financial system is specifically used for collecting, processing, maintaining, transmitting, and reporting data regarding financial events. Other uses include supporting financial planning, budgeting activities, and preparing financial statements. Any data transfers to the core financial system must be: traceable to the transaction source; posted to the core financial system in accordance with applicable guidance from the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB); and in the data format of the core financial system.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A mixed system is an information system that can support both financial and non-financial functions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A financial management system includes the core financial systems and the financial portions of mixed systems necessary to support financial management, including automated and manual processes, procedures, and controls, data, hardware, software, and support personnel dedicated to the operation and maintenance of system functions. The following are examples of financial management systems: core financial systems, procurement systems, loan systems, grants systems, payroll systems, budget formulation systems, billing systems, and travel systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A financial event is any activity having financial consequences to the Federal government related to the receipt of appropriations or other financial resources; acquisition of goods or services; payments or collections; recognition of guarantees, benefits to be provided, or other potential liabilities; distribution of grants; or other reportable financial activities.</p>

<p class='context'>6. Policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. FSIO Certified Commercial System</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> use a core financial system that is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system and has been certified by the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) as meeting the core financial system requirements. If the core financial system is not up-to-date with FSIO certification, agencies should consider upgrading to a certified version of the same COTS product or implement a different certified product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>B. FSIO Testing</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[Financial Systems Integration Office] FSIO <strong>will</strong> establish processes for testing COTS software products supporting core financial system requirements. The test <strong>will</strong> verify that the COTS products meet the core financial system requirements. The product configuration used in the test <strong>will</strong> become the certified configuration for that software product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>C. Frequency of FSIO Testing</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] certification tests <strong>are to be</strong> conducted as prescribed in the <a href="#not-implemented">Core Federal Financial System Software Qualification Testing Policy</a> issued by FSIO.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>D. Policy Exceptions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In general, agencies <strong>will</strong> not be exempt from any part of the policy. However, there <strong>may</strong> be two exceptions given a legitimate need: (1) deviation from the standard configurations (see Section 6.E [page 4]; and (2) exception to competition when upgrading or modernizing core financial systems (see Section 7.D). [page 6]</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>E. Standard Configuration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> utilize the certified configurations as defined, tested and certified by FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] as they become available. However, exceptions may be granted if there is a legitimate and valid need for them. To obtain an exception to deviate from the certified configurations, OMB <strong>must</strong> first be provided with a justification for approval. Agencies <strong>will be</strong> required to register any approved configuration changes with FSIO. FSIO will issue guidance, as needed, with respect to implementing the certified configurations and requesting and reporting deviations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>F. Periodic Review of Standard Configuration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies that have implemented core financial systems with the certified configurations <strong>will</strong> undergo periodic reviews which <strong>will</strong> be performed by FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office]. The reviews <strong>will</strong> assess whether deviations occurred from the certified version. FSIO <strong>will</strong> issue guidance with respect to these periodic reviews.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>G. Adoption of Standard Business Processes</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies are <strong>required</strong> to adopt the standard government business processes as established by FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office]. These standards will be included in the FSIO�s core financial system requirements documentation. The standards <strong>should</strong> be adopted as agencies upgrade to the next major release of their current core financial system or migrate to a different core financial system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>H. Implementation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>During implementation, agencies <strong>must</strong> monitor the project�s progress and institute performance measures to ensure that it is on schedule and within budget. Agencies <strong>must</strong> also assess risks regularly and mitigate them in a timely manner. To do so, agencies <strong>must</strong> provide periodic briefings to OMB, at its request, that detail the project�s progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>I. Maintenance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> ensure that their service provider periodically performs on-going maintenance of the core financial system to support the most current Federal business practices and systems requirements. Agencies <strong>must</strong> also verify whether their service provider is continuing to meet its Service Level Agreement.</p>

<p class='context'>N. Non-Core Financial System Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Specific non-core financial system requirements, previously published by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) and known as the JFMIP Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) series, <strong>should be</strong> regarded as guidance when defining system requirements for acquisition. The FFMSR requirements <strong>are</strong> not part of the Federal financial management systems requirements for FFMIA and therefore should not be used to determine substantial compliance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>7. Service Provider Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. Use of External Providers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When upgrading to the next major release of its current core financial system or modernizing to a different core financial system, an agency <strong>must</strong> use an external provider which is either a Federal shared service provider that has been designated by OMB or a commercial vendor. The implemented system <strong>must</strong> also be maintained by the external provider. If agencies cannot migrate to an external provider immediately, then they <strong>should</strong> take incremental steps by moving their hosting or application management support to a provider.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>B. Minimum Requirements of External Providers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The external provider <strong>must</strong> demonstrate to the Federal agency its ability to:<br />1) meet applicable Federal requirements, (e.g., the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (<a href="#not-implemented">FISMA</a>) and compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and FFMIA);<br />2) operate and maintain a COTS [commercial off the shelf] software package that complies with FSIO�s core financial system requirements;<br />3) meet the requirements of the <a href="#not-implemented">Financial Management Due Diligence Checklist</a>; and<br />4) provide a SAS 70 audit report to its customers or allow customer auditors to perform appropriate tests of internal controls at its organization. FSIO will maintain and publish the most current list of OMB designated Federal service providers and the Due Diligence Checklist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>C. Competitive Process</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>are required</strong> to hold a competition among the OMB designated Federal providers and commercial vendors when upgrading their current core financial system or modernizing to a different core financial system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>D. Competition Exemption</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> be allowed to conduct a non-competitive migration or a competitive migration involving only commercial providers (if authorized by law) or OMB designated providers if they prepare a full justification, generally including the type of information called for by section 6.303-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The justification <strong>shall</strong> be approved by the agency�s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Acquisition officer. Agencies <strong>shall</strong> confer with OMB prior to proceeding with a migration that is noncompetitive or is otherwise limited in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An agency <strong>may</strong> rely on its in-house operations if the agency demonstrates to OMB that its internal operations represent a best value and lower risk alternative. This demonstration <strong>shall</strong> be made through the establishment of a most efficient organization and public-private competition, unless there is a justified basis for foregoing competition or for using a limited form of competition, such as public-public competition. The justification <strong>shall</strong> be documented in the same general manner prescribed in Part 6 of the FAR for the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>E. Tracking Results</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> monitor performance, regardless of the selected service provider, for all performance periods stated in the solicitation. Performance measurement and reporting <strong>shall</strong> be consistent with OMB guidance on earned value management. See OMB Memorandum <a href="#not-implemented">M-05-23</a>.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>8. FFMIA Compliance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. Definition of Substantial Compliance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Substantial compliance is achieved when an agency�s financial management systems routinely provide reliable and timely financial information for managing day-to-day operations as well as to produce reliable financial statements, maintain effective internal control, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. FFMIA substantial compliance <strong>will</strong> be determined annually at the department-wide or agency-wide level for the 24 major CFO Act agencies. Agencies <strong>can</strong> determine whether the requirements are being met by applying the FFMIA risk model, which ranks risks from nominal to significant (See Figure 1). The risk indicators in the model assist agencies in determining whether reliable and consistent information is available for decision making. The higher the risk, the more likely the agency is non-compliant. [Footnote] The 24 CFO Act agencies are defined in Appendix A of the OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended. [see page 7 for diagram]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If agencies fall under a nominal risk category, then the risk of noncompliance is low. Meeting the indicators for nominal risk signals that substantial compliance is adequately supported and additional supporting information should not be necessary. However, during the course of its financial statements audit, the financial statement auditor may request additional information to support compliance or, at its discretion, perform further testing. If agencies are under a significant risk category, then they are not in compliance with FFMIA and <strong>must</strong> identify remediation plans and resolve them. Agencies under moderate risk <strong>may need</strong> to provide further information to support compliance. Specific guidance may be found in the <a href="#not-implemented">FFMIA Implementation Guide of 2008</a>. [see page 7 for diagram]</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[1. Federal Financial Management System Requirements]<br />a. Computer Security Requirements: The security controls requirements are defined by <a href="#not-implemented">FISMA</a> and <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-130</a> and/or successor documents.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[1. Federal Financial Management System Requirements]<br />b. Internal Controls: The internal controls requirements are internal control objectives of <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-123 (including the body of the A-123 and Appendix A)</a>, which ensure resource use is consistent with laws, regulations, and policies; resources are safeguarded against waste, loss, and misuse; and reliable data are obtained, maintained, and disclosed in reports.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[1. Federal Financial Management System Requirements]<br />c. FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] Core Financial System Requirements: The core financial system requirements are defined by FSIO�s core financial system requirements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>2. Federal Accounting Standards:<br />When applicable, agency financial management systems <strong>shall</strong> maintain accounting data to permit reporting in accordance with Federal accounting standards, and reporting requirements issued by the Director of OMB and/or the Secretary of the Treasury. Where no accounting standards have been recommended by FASAB and issued by the Director of OMB, the systems <strong>shall</strong> maintain data in accordance with the applicable accounting standards used by the agency for preparation of its financial statements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>3. Application of the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the Transaction Level:<br />Financial events <strong>shall</strong> be recorded applying the requirements of the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger (USSGL). Application of the USSGL at the transaction level means that each time an approved transaction is recorded in the system, it will generate appropriate general ledger accounts for posting the transaction according to the rules defined in the USSGL guidance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>D. Applicability of FFMIA</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies covered by the <a href="#not-implemented">CFO Act</a> <strong>must</strong> comply with the <a href="#not-implemented">FFMIA Section 803(a)</a> requirements. Agencies not covered under the Act are not required to comply with the FFMIA requirements, but are still encouraged to adhere to them. The FFMIA law requires all financial management systems to adhere to <a href="#not-implemented">FFMIA Section 803(a)</a> requirements. However, certain Section 803(a) requirements will only be applicable to the core financial system. All systems <strong>must</strong> be in compliance with computer security and internal controls requirements. However, only core financial systems <strong>must</strong> be compliant with FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] core financial system requirements and accounting standards as well as apply the USSGL [U.S. Government Standard General Ledger] at the transaction level. The core system requirements do not apply to mixed systems unless the systems perform the core system function. Additionally, mixed systems <strong>should</strong> only adhere to the specific 9 accounting standards that are applicable to mixed systems (e.g., loans). Finally, mixed systems do not have to record transactions using USSGL accounts. Nonetheless, data coming from the mixed system <strong>must</strong> be posted to the core financial system using proper USSGL accounts and accounting standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>E. Review of Financial Management Systems</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> perform an annual review of their financial management systems to verify compliance with computer security and internal controls. When reviewing their systems, agencies <strong>should</strong> leverage the results of related reviews such as those required by <a href="#not-implemented">FISMA</a> and <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-123</a>. In general, agencies using the latest FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] certified financial system are not required to perform a separate review of their core financial system to verity compliance with the FSIO core financial systems requirements, accounting standards, or USSGL. Agencies that do not use the latest version of the FSIO certified system <strong>may be</strong> required to perform self assessments of their core financial system.</p>

<p class='context'>9. Assignment of Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. Agency Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[1) Oversight of Financial Management Systems:] Agencies <strong>are responsible</strong> for managing their financial management systems even when they utilize a service provider to implement, operate and maintain the systems. Agencies <strong>must</strong> also ensure that their financial management systems meet applicable Federal requirements and are adequately supported throughout the systems� life cycle. All agreement and contracts with service providers <strong>must</strong> clearly outline the goals necessary to achieve sound financial management. Furthermore, agencies <strong>must</strong> monitor the service providers� performance and ensure that service failures are resolved promptly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[2) Develop and Maintain Agency-wide Financial Management System Plans:] Agencies <strong>must</strong> prepare a plan for their financial management systems, which incorporates their strategic plan, financial management plan, enterprise architecture, and budget request. Once a plan is established, it <strong>must</strong> be updated at least annually or earlier when a significant event occurs (e.g., reorganization).<br /><br />In establishing a plan, an agency <strong>must</strong> consider its own financial management systems� life cycle. Specifically, it <strong>must</strong> project a reasonable useful life of the investment and plan the next system upgrade accordingly. Technology trends and product support schedules <strong>should be</strong> considered when projecting the useful life. The plan <strong>must</strong> also identify existing problems related to the current system.<br /><br />Each financial management system plan <strong>must</strong>:<br />a. describe the existing financial management system architecture and any changes needed to implement a targeted architecture;<br />b. be consistent with the enterprise architecture, information resource management plan, and IT capital plan;<br />c. provide a strategy for maintaining adequacy, consistency, and timeliness of financial information;<br />d. identify projects necessary to achieve <a href="#not-implemented">FFMIA</a> substantial compliance within three years from the date of noncompliance;<br />e. contain milestones for correcting any material weaknesses;<br />f. identify and make proposals to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary systems;<br />g. include a strategy to migrate to an external provider;<br />h. contain milestones for equipment acquisitions and other actions necessary to implement the plan;<br />i. identify financial management personnel needs and actions to ensure those needs are met; and<br />j. estimate the costs of implementing the plan.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once a plan is established, an agency <strong>must</strong> obtain approval from its Investment Review Board (IRB) if major changes are needed. The approved financial management systems plan will provide a basis for the agency�s business case. The business case <strong>must</strong> include an estimate of the full cost necessary to complete the upgrade, and have considered different alternatives in measuring the risks and costs for the plan. The business case will be used to justify funding and, therefore, <strong>must</strong> be clearly stated in the agency�s budget request. Agencies <strong>should</strong> communicate progress against the approved business case and financial management systems plan with OMB throughout the financial management system lifecycle. A summary of the plan <strong>should</strong> be included in the agency�s annual financial report as instructed in <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular No A-136</a>, �Financial Reporting Requirements.� For agencies not covered under the CFO Act, they need to prepare the plans but are not required to report them in their annual financial reports.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[3) Develop and Maintain an Agency-wide Inventory of Financial Management Systems] Agencies <strong>are required</strong> to maintain an inventory of their existing and proposed financial management systems. Annually, agencies <strong>will</strong> provide FSIO [Financial Systems Integration Office] with an annual inventory of their financial management systems.</p>
</li>

<li>

The security controls <strong>must</strong> include one of the three security control baselines from <a href="#not-implemented">NIST SP 800-53</a> that are associated with the designated categorization (impact levels) of their information systems.  The security control baselines define the set of minimum security controls for a low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact information system and provide a starting point for the tailoring process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security Control Baselines ; Agencies <strong>are required to</strong> tailor the security control baselines to customize their safeguarding measures for specific missions, business lines, and operational environments�and to do so in a cost-effective, risk-based manner.  Tailoring allows agencies to designate common controls; apply scoping considerations; select compensating controls; assign specific values to agency-defined control parameters; supplement baselines with additional controls when necessary; and provide additional specification information for control implementation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security Control Baselines ; Agencies <strong>must</strong> include a justification, in their information system security plans or overlays, for any tailoring actions that result in changes to the initial security control baselines.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security Control Baselines ; Agencies <strong>are not permitted to</strong> make changes to security control baselines when such changes result in control selections that are inconsistent with security requirements set forth in Federal statutes, executive orders, regulations, directives, or policies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security Control Baselines ; Agencies <strong>may</strong> also develop overlays for specific types of information or communities of interest (e.g., all web-based applications, all health care-related systems) as part of the security control selection process.  Overlays provide a specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting information as part of the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security control baselines.  The overlay <strong>may</strong> be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control baseline and can be applied to multiple information systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security Control Baselines ; All selected security controls <strong>must</strong> be documented in an information system security plan and implemented.

<p class='context'>Security and Privacy Assessments</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security and Privacy Assessments ; Agencies <strong>must</strong> ensure that periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security and privacy policies, procedures, and practices are performed with a frequency depending on risk, but at least annually.  However, this general requirement to test and evaluate the effectiveness of information security and privacy policies, procedures, and practices does not imply that agencies <strong>must</strong> assess every selected and implemented security and privacy control at least annually.  Rather, agencies <strong>must</strong> continuously monitor all implemented security and privacy controls (i.e., system-specific, hybrid, and common controls) with a frequency determined by the agency in accordance with the ISCM and PCM strategies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security and Privacy Assessments ; These strategies <strong>will</strong> define the specific security and privacy controls selected for assessment during any one-year period (i.e., the annual assessment window) with the understanding that all controls may not be formally assessed every year.  Rotational assessment of security and privacy controls is consistent with the transition to ongoing authorization and assumes the information system has completed an initial authorization where all controls were formally assessed for effectiveness.  As the transition to ongoing authorization progresses and agency ISCM programs mature, agencies must ensure that assessment frequencies are determined in accordance with NIST SP 800-137.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is language from OMB Circular A-130, follow link for full document] ; Appendix I ; Security and Privacy Assessments ; Security and privacy control assessments <strong>shall</strong> ensure that security and privacy controls selected by agencies are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and effective in satisfying security and privacy requirements.

<p class='context'>Executive Summary</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>The national dialogue on cybersecurity must begin today.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> initiate a national public awareness and education campaign informed by previous successful campaigns. Further, similar to the period after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October, 1957, the United States is in a global race that depends on mathematics and science skills. While we continue to boast the most positive environment for information technology firms in the world, the Nation <strong>should</strong> develop a workforce of U.S. citizens necessary to compete on a global level and sustain that position of leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the next-generation infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the next-generation infrastructure. The United States <strong>should</strong> harness the full benefits of technology to address national economic needs and national security requirements. Federal policy <strong>should</strong> address requirements for national security, protection of intellectual property, and the availability and continuity of infrastructure, even when it is under attack by sophisticated adversaries. The Federal government through partnerships with the private sector and academia needs to articulate coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives. The government, working with State and local partners, <strong>should</strong> identify procurement strategies that will incentivize the market to make more secure products and services available to the public. Additional incentive mechanisms that the government <strong>should</strong> explore include adjustments to liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>I. Leading from the Top</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Anchor Leadership at the White House</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President <strong>should</strong> consider appointing a cybersecurity policy official at the White House, reporting to the NSC [National Security Council] and dual-hatted with the NEC [National Economic Council], to coordinate the Nation�s cybersecurity-related policies and activities. This individual <strong>would</strong> chair the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] and lead a strong process in consultation with other elements of the EOP to resolve competing priorities and coordinate interagency development of policies and strategies for cybersecurity. The cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> participate in all appropriate economic, counterterrorism, and science and technology policy discussions to inform them of cybersecurity perspectives.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To be successful, the President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>must</strong> have clear presidential support, authority, and sufficient resources to operate effectively in policy formulation and the coordination of interagency cybersecurity-related activities. The cybersecurity policy official should be supported by at least two Senior Directors and appropriate staff from the NSC [National Security Council] and at least one Senior Director and appropriate staff from the NEC [National Economic Council]. These directorates <strong>would</strong> report through the cybersecurity policy official and work together in pursuit of the goals set forth in this paper and established as national policy. In addition, to achieve additional scale and integration across the NSC, each NSC  regional and functional directorate should designate an individual to be responsible for following cybersecurity-related issues in the directorate�s portfolio and coordinating with the directorate for cybersecurity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official <strong><strong>should</strong> not</strong> have operational responsibility or authority, nor the authority to make policy unilaterally. Using interagency coordination processes, the cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> harmonize cybersecurity-related policy and technology efforts across the Federal government, ensure that the President�s budget reflects federal priorities for cybersecurity, and develop a legislative agenda, all in consultation with the Federal government�s Chief Technology Officer and Chief Information Officer�along with the appropriate entities within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the NEC [National Economic Council].</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To facilitate coordination, all federal departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> establish a point-of-contact in their respective executive suites authorized to interface with the White House on cybersecurity related issues.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official�through the interagency policy development process�<strong>should</strong> prepare for the President�s consideration an updated national strategy to secure the information and communications infrastructure. The strategy <strong>should</strong> include continued evaluation of CNCI activities and build, where appropriate, on its successes. The national strategy <strong>should</strong> focus senior leadership attention and time toward resolving issues that hamper U.S. efforts to achieve an assured, reliable, secure, and resilient global information and communications infrastructure and related capabilities. The strategy <strong>would</strong> assist government efforts to raise public awareness, renew and build international alliances and public-private partnerships, establish a more comprehensive national cyber response and recovery plan, and promote an aggressive research and development agenda that has the potential to result in new technologies that will enhance cybersecurity.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue the principle of �mission bridging� started under the CNCI. Departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> expand the sharing of expertise, knowledge, and perspectives about threats, tradecraft, technology, and vulnerabilities between network defenders and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement organizations that develop U.S. operational capabilities in cyberspace.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] the cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> help coordinate intelligence and military policies and strategies for cyberspace�including for countering terrorist use of the Internet�to ensure integration of all mission equities. The cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> engage external advisory bodies. Many advisory bodies touch on cybersecurity-related issues, including the National Security and Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC), and the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB). The cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> review the responsibilities of these bodies and propose changes as necessary to optimize advice and eliminate unnecessary duplication.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] the cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, <strong>will need to</strong> ensure effective implementation of cybersecurity-related policy and activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, <strong>should</strong> develop structural options to perform appropriate oversight, implementation, and other functions. These could include among others, developing a JIACTF-like function in OMB or elsewhere in the EOP, creating an entity similar to President Eisenhower�s Operations Coordinating Board, or establishing some other entity that, among other things, assists in assessing department and agency performance and oversees federal compliance with cybersecurity standards. Unless and until such an office is established, the work of the JIACTF [Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force] <strong>should</strong> continue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Review Laws and Policies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with departments and agencies to recommend coherent unified policy guidance where necessary in order to clarify authorities, roles, and responsibilities for cybersecurity-related activities across the Federal government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Administration <strong>should</strong> partner appropriately with Congress to ensure adequate law, policies, and resources are available to support the U.S. cybersecurity-related missions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, <strong>should</strong> consult with industry to understand the impact of laws and policies on business operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Strengthen Federal Leadership and Accountability for Cybersecurity.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadership and accountability <strong>must</strong> extend throughout the Federal government. Including cybersecurity among the President�s management priorities and assessing the progress of departments and agencies against stated goals <strong>would</strong> provide additional means to ensure accountability and progress. The cybersecurity policy official�in consultation with NSC [National Security Council], OMB, NEC [National Economic Council], and OSTP�<strong>would</strong> define the milestones and success criteria and raise the visibility of cybersecurity within all agency budgets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To bring transparency and effective management to the overall portfolio for cybersecurity, OMB <strong>should</strong> use its program assessment framework to ensure departments and agencies use performance-based budgeting in pursuing cybersecurity-related goals. A formal program assessment framework for cybersecurity <strong>would</strong> have departments and agencies define each program�s purpose and goal as well as identify metrics to evaluate whether goals are achieved. The CNCI [Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative] has used a variation on this approach successfully.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Department and agency leaders <strong>must</strong> be held accountable, as required by the Federal Information Security Management Act (<a href="#not-implemented">FISMA</a>) of 2002. The Administration <strong>should</strong> work with Congress to update and strengthen this legislation. Performance plans of the department and agency leadership <strong>should</strong> include reporting on progress made to secure systems by each department and agency. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> develop options to hold department and agency leadership accountable for compliance with cybersecurity policies and to enforce implementation of appropriate cybersecurity procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Elevate State, Local, and Tribal Leadership.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>State, local, and tribal governments <strong>should</strong> consider the need to elevate cybersecurity as an issue by designating a single leader to ensure effective coordination between Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), and State Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs). The review team heard from representatives of the National Governors Association that cybersecurity is the weakest link in their efforts to protect critical infrastructure assets in their individual states. HSAs can spend funds under a number of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant programs for cybersecurity efforts, but historically grant funds to a large extent have not been prioritized for cybersecurity. State, local, and tribal governments <strong>should</strong> consider whether to elevate cybersecurity as an issue and <strong>should</strong> ensure that CIOs, CISOs, and HSAs coordinate to achieve a robust defensive posture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>II. Building Capacity for a Digital Nation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The United States <strong>should</strong> initiate a K-12 cybersecurity education program for digital safety, ethics, and security; expand university curricula; and set the conditions to create a competent workforce for the digital age. To help Achieve these goals, the Nation <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Promote cybersecurity risk awareness for all citizens;<br />� Build an education system that will enhance understanding of cybersecurity and allow the United States to retain and expand upon its scientific, engineering, and market leadership in information technology;<br />� Expand and train the workforce to protect the Nation�s competitive advantage; and<br />� Help organizations and individuals make smart choices as they manage risk.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Increase Public Awareness</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government, in partnership with educators and industry, <strong>should</strong> conduct a national cybersecurity public awareness and education. The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> lead the development and direct the implementation of this public awareness strategy and <strong>should</strong> seek endorsement by Congress; State, local, and tribal governments; the private sector; and the civil liberties and privacy communities. The strategy <strong>should</strong> involve public education about the threat and how to enhance digital safety, ethics, and security. This campaign <strong>should</strong> focus on public messages to promote responsible use of the Internet and awareness of fraud, identity theft, cyber predators, and cyber ethics. Past successful public safety campaigns such as Smokey Bear on fire safety and the Click It or Ticket campaign for seat belt safety could be used as a model to inform and persuade the public about the importance of cybersecurity. These public service campaigns <strong>should</strong> focus on making cybersecurity popular for children and for older students choosing careers. Celebrities, the generation that has grown up with the technology, and new types of media can play critical roles in delivering the message effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Increase Cybersecurity Education</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government, with the participation of all departments and agencies, <strong>should</strong> expand support for key education programs and research and development to ensure the Nation�s continued ability to compete in the information age economy. Existing programs <strong>should</strong> be evaluated and possibly expanded, and other activities could serve as models for additional programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Expand Federal Information Technology Workforce</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, in coordination with the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], <strong>should</strong> consider how to better attract cybersecurity expertise and to increase retention of employees with such expertise within the federal service.  Departments and agencies have had success attracting new employees from industry, but the time required to obtain, transfer, or renew security clearances leads to lost opportunities. Federal employees <strong>need to</strong> be able to build portfolios and advance careers in ways they might not be able to do within a single agency. Shared training and rotational assignments across agencies and potentially with the private sector would not only be efficient, but would promote beneficial cross-fertilization and the building of professional networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Promote Cybersecurity as an Enterprise Leadership Responsibility</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue to facilitate programs and information sharing on threats, vulnerabilities, and effective practices across all levels of government and industry. It is not enough for the information technology workforce to understand the importance of cybersecurity; leaders at all levels of government and industry need to be able to make business and investment decisions based on knowledge of risks and potential impacts. State, local, and tribal governments face similar issues. State governments often serve as incubators for innovation and thus may be able to provide lessons learned in managing information and communications infrastructure. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue to work with industry to identify and disseminate effective practices in secure design and operation of information technology products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>III. Sharing Responsibility for Cybersecurity</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Government and industry leaders�both nationally and internationally�<strong>need to</strong> delineate roles and responsibilities, integrate capabilities, and take ownership of the problem to develop holistic solutions. Only through such partnerships will the United States be able to enhance cybersecurity and reap the full benefits of the digital revolution. The global challenge of securing cyberspace requires an increased effort in multilateral forums. This effort <strong>should</strong> seek�in continued collaboration with the private sector�to improve the security of interoperable networks through the development of global standards, expand the legal system�s capacity to combat cyber crime, continue to develop and promote best practices, and maintain stable and effective Internet governance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Improve Partnership Between Private Sector and Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with relevant departments and agencies and the private sector to examine existing public-private partnership and information sharing mechanisms to identify or build upon the most effective models. [Footnote:] These include organizations such as the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) and its constituent bodies such as the Enduring Security Framework, the Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) and Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs); the Federal Bureau of Investigation�s InfraGard; the U.S. Secret Service�s Electronic Crimes Task Forces; the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC); the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC); the Homeland Security Advisory Council; and the associated subcommittees and working groups.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> streamline, align, and provide resources to existing organizations to optimize their capacity to identify priorities, enable more efficient execution, and develop response and recovery plans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Evaluate Potential Barriers Impeding Evolution of Public-Private Partnership</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the partnership [between Public and Private], government <strong>should</strong> work creatively and collaboratively with the private sector to identify tailored solutions that take into account both the need to exchange information and protect public and private interests and take an integrated approach to national and economic security. These solutions <strong>should</strong> identify clear, actionable objectives for the sharing of data and define standards for incident reporting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>could</strong> also consider ways in which it <strong>could</strong> focus more resources on research into possible �game-changing� areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based cybersecurity solutions. The Federal government <strong>could</strong> also consider ways in which it <strong>could</strong> focus more resources on research into possible �game-changing� areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based cybersecurity solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Partner Effectively With the International Community</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong>, working with departments and agencies, strengthen and integrate interagency processes to formulate and coordinate international cybersecurity-related positions. In addition, the Federal government�continuing the long-term history of collaboration with the private sector�<strong>should</strong> develop a proactive engagement plan for use with international standards bodies. This <strong>would</strong> include taking stock of current policies and coordinating the development, refinement, or reaffirmation of positions to ensure that the full range of cybersecurity-related economic, national security, public safety, and privacy interests are taken into account.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with departments and agencies to enhance the identification, tracking, and prioritization of international venues, negotiations, and discussions where cybersecurity-related agreements, standards, activities, and policies are being developed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Working with the private sector, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> coordinate and expand international partnerships to address the full range of cybersecurity-related activities, policies, and opportunities associated with the information and communications infrastructure upon which U.S. businesses, government services, the U.S. military, and nations depend. New agreements between governments and industry may need to be documented to enable international information sharing as well as strategic and operational collaboration. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> increase resources and attention dedicated to conducting outreach and building foreign capacity. For example, the United States <strong>should</strong> accelerate efforts to help other countries build legal frameworks and capacity to fight cybercrime and continue efforts to promote cybersecurity practices and standards. The United States also <strong>should</strong> work with allies to ensure the stability and global interoperability of the Internet, while increasing security and reliability for all users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>IV. creating Effective information Sharing and incident response</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Federal, State, local, and tribal governments <strong>should</strong> work with industry to improve the plans and resources they have in place in advance to detect, prevent, and respond to significant cybersecurity incidents.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Build a Framework for Incident Response</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> be the White House action officer for cyber incident response (a similar role to the action officers who help the White House monitor terrorist attacks or natural disasters).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> have a clear and authoritative cyber incident response framework that needs to be documented in a revised Cyber Incident Annex for the National Response Framework.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] process <strong>should</strong> define roles, responsibilities, and resources for different departments and agencies with respect to incident response - harmonized or enhanced as necessary - recognizing the different aspects of incident response and the different strengths various communities�network security, law enforcement, intelligence, and military�bring to the table.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government - in collaboration with State, local, and tribal governments and industry - <strong>should</strong> develop a set of threat scenarios and metrics that all can use for risk management decisions, recovery planning, and prioritization of R&D. Modeling and simulation capabilities <strong>should</strong> be developed to help exercise these plans and determine potential levels of damage.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee] <strong>should</strong> develop clear, enforceable rules for timely reporting of incidents by departments and agencies to enable an effective and efficient interagency response.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, working with the ICI-IPC, <strong>should</strong> determine the most efficient and effective method of developing and maintaining situational awareness and incident response capabilities. The CNCI effort <strong>should</strong> continue to improve federal network defenses but consider the need for adjustments or additions to implementation plans. In particular, the President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Work with the private sector to explore how best to apply technical capabilities to the defense of the national infrastructure and what legal framework would be required to ensure the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties.<br />� Review the operational concept and the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Center (NCSC) to determine whether its proposed responsibilities, resource strategy, and governance are adequate to enable it to provide the shared situational awareness necessary to support cyber incident response efforts<br />� Continue to pursue the goal of the Trusted Internet Connection program to reduce the number of government network connections to the Internet but reconsider goals and timelines based on a realistic assessment of the challenges. Some departments and agencies during the past two years made progress reducing the number of connections and beginning the deployment of systems that will help the Federal government prevent as well as detect malicious behavior. The government, however, still has considerable work to do before full capability is achieved and may need to consider additional policies to enable full implementation of the strategy<br />� Evaluate and continue, as appropriate - in ongoing consultation with the civil liberties and privacy community - pilot deployments of intrusion detection and prevention systems for the benefit of federal networks, evaluate the performance of these systems, and continue studies of the issues that would arise if such capabilities were used with State government systems. These sensors will be vital to gaining situational awareness for federal networks, and the government will benefit from any policy, legal, or technology lessons learned as these deployments move forward.<br />� Explore - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy community - additional, long-term architectures for intrusion detection and prevention systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> improve its ability to provide strategic warning of cyber intrusions and attacks to the President. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> continue to leverage the Nation�s long-term investments in the fundamental development of cryptologic and information assurance technologies and the necessary supporting infrastructure. These investments, along with other intelligence capabilities, are critical to national strategic warning for attacks through cyberspace. In addition, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> identify any gaps in law enforcement capacity or investigative authority needed to defend the Nation�s infrastructure. Any new authorities would need to be consistent with the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The U.S. Government <strong>should</strong> invest in processes, technologies, and infrastructure that will help prevent cyber incidents. Options include increased security testing, investment in systems that automate or centralize network management, and more restricted connectivity to the Internet for some unclassified systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> consider whether available alternative or reserve communications would be adequate in the event of a major disruption of information and communications infrastructure, particularly as information and communications networks converge. Replacement or repair of infrastructure may also require additional planning and resources, particularly in the event of physical damage to networks or hard-to-replace components of the power grid.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> develop processes between all levels of government and the private sector to assist in preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber incidents by leveraging existing resources. To help build situational awareness related to the information and communications infrastructure, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> leverage existing resources such as the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the 58 State and local Fusion Centers that have been set up around the country.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Enhance Information Sharing To Improve Incident Response Capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector�including data owners, network operators, and experts on privacy and civil liberties�to develop options for cybersecurity-related information sharing that address concerns with privacy and proprietary information and make information sharing mutually beneficial in the national interest. Private companies <strong>are</strong> concerned about the potential uses of their information. The government <strong>must</strong> protect privacy rights, law enforcement equities, intelligence sources and methods, and government information that would provide unfair competitive advantages. Clarity and accountability for both government and the private sector <strong>are</strong> needed to address these concerns. Possible options include:<br />� Creation of a not-for-profit non-governmental organization to serve as a trusted third-party host where government and private sector information may be shared to enhance the security of critical government and private-sector networks. Such an organization could leverage commercial services without disrupting the growing security service market.<br />� Continued engagement between the Federal government (e.g., law enforcement agencies) and individual firms or groups of firms�possibly with the participation of State, local, and tribal governments�that could achieve a level of voluntary information sharing within a particular sector or region beyond what could be achieved in a broader setting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Administration <strong>should</strong> consider, in consultation with affected parties and Congress, developing tailored incentives for information sharing. These measures might include, as a last resort, regulatory measures as part of an integrated approach to satisfying society�s interests in robust and resilient critical infrastructures, civil liberties and privacy protections, and maintaining the fair and open economic markets that underlie the U.S. economic system. Privacy enhancing technologies such as encryption or controlled access authentication could ameliorate some risks in sharing information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> undertake a comprehensive review of policies (such as security classification and clearance requirements) that inhibit interagency sharing of cybersecurity information, seek improvements in information sharing, and <strong>ensure</strong> that they preserve civil liberties and privacy rights and appropriate protection for sensitive information. This review <strong>should</strong> take into account the progress that the Federal government has made through the Security and Suitability Reform Initiative and the Information Sharing Environment effort in examining all facets of the security and suitability processing components.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with the private sector to develop standards for incident reporting by private-sector network operators to the Federal government. Industry has expressed concerns about reporting cyber incidents to which they have fallen victim, including the potential for negative impacts from resulting shareholder concerns, market reactions, or regulatory action. One industry group has proposed a government-industry working group to define sector-specific cyber incident thresholds that warrant reporting to security officials. Use of such information by the government would require rules and oversight, particularly for the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties. Another way to increase reporting is through consideration of appropriate data breach notification laws that require notification to the public and to the government, including law enforcement entities that could pursue investigations. The Federal government also <strong>should</strong> examine the effectiveness and scope of existing reporting requirements for regulated markets.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>needs to</strong> define processes and rules for sharing its incident reporting with the private sector. Formulation of these rules <strong>should</strong> consider classification and privacy issues. In addition, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> help the research community gain access, with appropriate controls, to cybersecurity - related event data that could be used to develop tools, test theories, and develop workable solutions. Such sharing <strong>would</strong> need to address the protection of sensitive or proprietary data and personal identity information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> explore expanded sharing of information about network incidents and vulnerabilities with major allies, seeking bilateral or multilateral arrangements that improve cybersecurity consistent with the protection of other U.S. economic and security interests and the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.</p>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with the private sector to define public-private partnership roles and responsibilities for the defense of privately owned critical infrastructure and key resources.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> consider options for incentivizing collective action and enhance competition in the development of cybersecurity solutions. For example, the legal concepts for �standard of care� to date do not exist for cyberspace. Possible incentives include adjustments to liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official <strong>should</strong> work with all levels of government, the private sector, and our international partners to develop strategies and plans to encourage the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions and ensure the security and resilience of infrastructure systems.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>The Future</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government, the private sector, and other stakeholders together <strong>should</strong> define technology-neutral performance and security objectives for future infrastructure, both to meet its own requirements as a consumer as well as in its capacity as a steward of the public interest. The Federal government and its partners <strong>should</strong> create a family of coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives, customized by sectors and organizations. These objectives could consider different models of computing platforms or network control concepts, and the emergence of technology solutions from government, academic, or industry research programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Link R&D Frameworks to Infrastructure Development</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Under the leadership of the President�s cybersecurity policy official, in collaboration with other EOP entities and the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], the Federal government <strong>should</strong> provide a framework for research and development strategies that focus on game-changing technologies that will help meet infrastructure objectives, building on the existing Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) strategies and other R&D-related work. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> greatly expand coordination of these strategies with industry and academic research efforts to avoid duplication, leverage and synchronize complementary capabilities and agendas, and ensure that technology transitions and enters into the marketplace.<br />� To enhance U.S. competitiveness, the Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with industry to develop migration paths and incentives for the rapid adoption of research and technology development, including encouragement of collaboration between academic and industrial laboratories.<br />� The Federal government, in collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders, also <strong>should</strong> use the infrastructure objectives and the R&D framework to help define goals for national and international standards bodies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Establish Identity Management as an Option</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy communities - <strong>should</strong> build a cybersecurity-based identity management vision and strategy for the Nation that considers an array of approaches, including privacy-enhancing technologies. The Federal government must interact with citizens through myriad information, services, and benefit programs and thus has an interest in the protection of the public�s private information as well. Increased use of on-line transactions involving financial, health, and commerce require a basis for building trust between the parties to a transaction.<br />� The Nation <strong>should</strong> implement, for high-value activities (e.g., the Smart Grid), an opt-in array of interoperable identity management systems to build trust for online transactions and to enhance privacy.<br />� The National Science and Technology Council�s (NSTC�s) Subcommittee on Biometrics and Identity Management in 2008 published a report that provides a vision for future federal identity management and a series of research and development recommendations. The Federal government <strong>should</strong> use this report as a starting point for identity management strategies.<br />� The Federal government <strong>should</strong> work with international partners to develop policies that encourage the development of a global, trusted eco-system that protects privacy rights and civil liberties and governs appropriate use of law enforcement activities to protect citizens and infrastructures.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong> ensure resources are available for full federal implementation of <a href="#not-implemented">HSPD-12</a>. The Federal government also <strong>should</strong> consider extending the availability of federal identity management systems to operators of critical infrastructure and to private sector emergency response and repair service providers for use during national emergencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Integrate Globalization Policy with Supply Chain Security</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The President�s cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Define procurement strategies through the General Services Administration, building on work by the National Security Agency for the Department of Defense, for commercial products and services in order to create market incentives for security to be part of hardware and software product designs, new security technologies, and secure managed services;<br />� Expand partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and international partners to maximize the market influence of these procurements;<br />� Work with Congress to identify mechanisms that would enable departments and agencies - under appropriate, limited situations - to incorporate threat information into acquisition decisions; and<br />�Work with industry to provide threat information and identify best practices for managing supply chain and insider risks, both from economic and threat perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Maintain National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Federal government <strong>should</strong>:<br />� Develop a coordinated plan for national security and emergency preparedness communications capabilities over next-generation networks, including milestones and funding requirements;<br />� Develop options for additional services the Federal government could acquire or direct investments the government could make in the information and communications infra structure to enhance the survivability of communications during a time of natural disaster, crisis, or conflict;<br />� Coordinate with international partners and standards bodies to support next-generation NS/EP communications capabilities in a globally distributed next-generation environment; and<br />� Ensure that efforts associated with the development of Executive Branch continuity communications architectures and next-generation services programs are adequately staffed and resourced.</p>

<p class='context'>Strategy Principles</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An �Information-Centric� approach � Moves us from managing �documents� to managing discrete pieces of open data and content which can be tagged, shared, secured, mashed up and presented in the way that is most useful for the consumer of that information. [Footnote:] Open data and content for the purposes of this document refers to digital information that is structured and exposed in a way that makes it accessible for meaningful use beyond its system of origin, be that internal to the government or external to the public.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A �Shared Platform� approach � Helps us work together, both within and across agencies, to reduce costs, streamline development, apply consistent standards, and ensure consistency in how we create and deliver information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A �Customer-Centric� approach � Influences how we create, manage, and present data through websites, mobile applications, raw data sets, and other modes of delivery, and allows customers to shape, share and consume information, whenever and however they want it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A platform of �Security and Privacy� � Ensures this innovation happens in a way that ensures the safe and secure delivery and use of digital services to protect information and privacy.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The DCOI [Data Center Optimization Initiative], as described in this memorandum, requires agencies to develop and report on data center strategies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Leadership and Responsibilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All data center infrastructure and services, including contracts for third-party data centers and services agency-wide, <strong>shall</strong> be managed by the agency CIO in a manner consistent with FITARA and OMB Memorandum M-15-14, �Management and Oversight of Information Technology.�</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The agency CIO <strong>shall</strong> be responsible for implementing and measuring progress toward meeting the goals set forth in this memorandum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Transition to Cloud and Data Center Shared Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Development Freeze for New and Current Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning 180 days after issuance of this memorandum, agencies <strong>may</strong> not budget any funds or resources toward initiating a new data center or significantly expanding an existing data center without approval from OMB OFCIO. [Footnote:] Data centers certified by GSA OGP as Inter agency Shared Service Provider data centers are excluded from this development freeze.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Footnote for Req. 21.03] The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) <strong>will</strong> coordinate with OMB to define thresholds for what constitutes �significant� expansion within 60 days of publication of this memorandum.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To request such approval [ref. Req. 21.05], agencies <strong>must</strong> submit a written justification that includes an analysis of alternatives (including opportunities for cloud services, inter-agency shared services, and third party co-location) and an explanation of the net reduction in the agency�s data center inventory that will be facilitated by the new or expanded data center (such as through consolidation of multiple existing data centers into a single new data center).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Consolidation and Closure of Existing Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As previously required by the FDCCI [Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative], agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to principally reduce application, system, and database inventories to essential enterprise levels by increasing the use of virtualization to enable pooling of storage, network and computer resources, and dynamic allocation on-demand.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> evaluate options for the consolidation and closure of existing data centers, by (in order of priority): <br />1. Transitioning to provisioned services, including configurable and flexible technology such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to the furthest extent practicable, consistent with the Cloud First policy.<br />2. Migrating to inter-agency shared services or co-location data centers.<br />3. Migrating to more optimized data centers within the agency�s data center inventory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p class='context'>Cloud Investment</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistent with the Cloud First policy, agencies <strong>shall</strong> use cloud infrastructure where possible when planning new mission or support applications or consolidating existing applications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> take into consideration cost, security requirements, and application needs when evaluating cloud environments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As required by <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a>, agencies utilizing cloud services <strong>shall</strong> do so in a manner that is consistent with requirements of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (<a href="#not-implemented">FedRAMP</a>) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Shared Services Managing Partner</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p class='context'>Classification of Physical Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> perform a comprehensive review of their data center inventories and continue to maintain complete and updated data center inventories. This comprehensive review <strong>shall</strong> be completed by August 31, 2016, to align with the Integrated Data Collection (IDC) process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Data centers <strong>shall</strong> be categorized into two groups: tiered data centers and non-tiered data centers. [Footnote:] The term �tiered� and the definitions that follow are derived from the Uptime Institute�s Tier Classification System; however, this <strong>shall</strong> not be construed as requiring any certification in order for a data center to be considered tiered by OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Private sector-provided cloud services <strong>are not</strong> considered data centers for the purposes of this memorandum, but <strong>must</strong> continue to be included in agencies' quarterly inventory data submissions to OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> self-classify data centers as either tiered or non-tiered data centers based on the above criteria; however, any data center previously reported to OMB as a Tier 1-4 data center <strong>shall</strong> be automatically categorized as a tiered data center.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Tiered data centers <strong>are</strong> defined as those that utilize each of the following: 1) a separate physical space for IT infrastructure; 2) an uninterruptible power supply; 3) a dedicated cooling system or zone; and 4) a backup power generator for prolonged power outages. All other data centers shall be considered non-tiered data centers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Energy Metering and Power Efficiency</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> install automated energy metering tools and <strong>shall</strong> use these to collect and report energy usage data in their data centers to OMB. The March 19, 2015, <a href="#not-implemented">Executive Order 13693</a>, "Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade," requires agencies to install and monitor advanced energy meters in data centers by September 30, 2018.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the Implementing Instructions for <a href="#not-implemented">Executive Order 13693</a> (E.O. Implementing Instructions), energy metering tools <strong>shall</strong> enable the active tracking of PUE for the data center and <strong>shall</strong> be installed in all tiered Federal data centers by September 30, 2018. [Footnote:] While <a href="#not-implemented">Executive Order 13693</a> requires advanced energy metering in all data centers, OMB will monitor PUE [power usage effectiveness] for tiered data centers only.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The E.O. Implementing Instructions also advise that "[a]ll existing and new data centers <strong>shall</strong> have at least one certified Data Center Energy Practitioner (DCEP) assigned to manage its performance."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, agency CIOs are also required under this memorandum to ensure that existing tiered data centers achieve and maintain a PUE [power usage effectiveness] of less than 1.5 by September 30, 2018.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency CIOs <strong>shall</strong> evaluate options for consolidation or closure of existing data centers in which a PUE [power usage effectiveness] target of less than 1.5 is not cost-effective, such as through transition to cloud services or migration to inter-agency shared services data centers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[�] OMB <strong>will</strong> monitor the energy efficiency of data center power and cooling infrastructure through the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, effective immediately, all new data centers <strong>must</strong> implement energy metering capable of measuring PUE [power usage effectiveness] and <strong>must</strong> be designed and operated to maintain a PUE no greater than 1.4, and are encouraged to be designed and operated to achieve a PUE no greater than 1.2.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To the extent permissible under the <a href="#not-implemented">Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)</a>, agencies <strong>must</strong> include PUE [power usage effectiveness] requirements for all new data center contracts or procurement vehicles.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[...] any new data center contract or procurement vehicle <strong>must require</strong> the contractor to report the quarterly average PUE [power usage effectiveness] of the contracted facility to the contracting agency, except where that data center�s PUE is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies <strong>are encourage</strong>d to require the same for extension of existing vehicles. [Footnote:] This can be PUE for the facility as a whole in cases where the agency only contracts for a portion of a larger facility; however, if PUE metrics are available specific to the agency�s use, that is preferred.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>PUE [power usage effectiveness] reporting <strong>is not</strong> required for cloud services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Automated Infrastructure Management</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> replace manual collections and reporting of systems, software, and hardware inventory housed within data centers with automated monitoring, inventory, and management tools (e.g., data center infrastructure management) by the end of fiscal year 2018. These tools  <strong>shall</strong> provide the capability to, at a minimum, measure progress toward the server utilization and virtualization metrics defined in the Metric Target Values section of this memorandum. [Footnote:] For non-tiered data centers, only automated monitoring of server utilization <strong>is required</strong>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any data center initiation, significant expansion, or migration project that receives Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DM&E) funds in fiscal year 2017 and beyond <strong>must</strong> immediately implement automated monitoring and management tools. However, agencies are strongly encouraged to implement automated monitoring and management tools throughout their data centers immediately.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To the extent permissible under the FAR, agencies <strong>must</strong> include automated infrastructure management requirements for all new data center service contracts or procurement vehicles. Further, any new data center contractor procurement vehicle <strong>must</strong> require the contractor to report to the contracting agency whether the contracted facility utilizes automated infrastructure management, except where such data is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies <strong>are encouraged</strong> to require the same for extension of existing vehicles.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>GSA <strong>shall</strong> make available an acquisition vehicle for automated monitoring and management tools to support agency needs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once established, agencies <strong>shall not</strong> issue new solicitations for these requirements unless they have developed a business case, approved by the agency�s CIO and shared with OMB, to establish that the separate procurement of these needs results in better value, considering price and other appropriate factors.</p>

<p class='context'>Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong>, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce Government-wide annual costs attributable to physical data centers by at least 25%, relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure Spending data submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard. Agencies <strong>shall</strong> collectively achieve the following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost avoidance) in each of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018:<br />[Table 2: Cost Savings Target:]<br />FY2014 Physical Data Center Spending: $5.4 billion <br />Total Savings Targeted by FYE 2018: $2.7 billion.<br /><br />[Footnotes] [Spending data] Benchmarked against the sum of all non cloud data center costs (including data center labor, software, hardware, electricity, and facility) found in physical data center fields of the IT Inventory Summary Table of the IT Dashboard.<br />[Footnote:] Consistent with <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-131</a>, the term �cost savings� refers to �a reduction in actual expenditures below the projected level of costs to achieve a specific objective,� and the term �cost avoidance� refers to �an action taken in the immediate time frame that will decrease costs in the future."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO <strong>will</strong> set individual cost savings and cost avoidance goals for each agency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Goal 3: Closed Data Centers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies <strong>shall</strong> close at least 25% of tiered data centers government-wide, excluding those approved as inter-agency shared services provider data centers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[By the end of FY 2018] agencies <strong>must</strong> close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government wide.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> prioritize the closure of data centers that are unable to meet applicable PUE [power usage effectiveness] optimization targets and/or pose management or security challenges due to age.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the long term, all agencies <strong>should</strong> continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers <strong>are required</strong> to be closed before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as temporary and work to close them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO <strong>will</strong> share with each agency its individual goal for data center closures, specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered data centers the agency must close. OMB may exclude from these agency-specific targets data centers that are physically inseparable from non-IT hardware (e.g. simulation and modeling devices, sensors, etc.) and that perform a specific, non-standard set of tasks (e.g. do not provide general purpose computing or storage services to Federal facilities).</p>

<p>To ensure that IT shared services are implemented in a coordinated and expedited manner,<br />Federal Agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) <strong><strong>will</strong> submit</strong> an "Enterprise Roadmap" to OMB by August 31, 2012 that covers Fiscal Years (FY) 2012-2015 and includes:<br />(1) Business and Technology Architecture: a high-level, integrated description of the agency's business objectives and enabling IT capabilities across all operating units and program areas � using enterprise architecture concepts and methods from the Common Approach to describe the agency-wide current architecture, future architecture, and transition plans. The transition plan <strong>will</strong> include a description of the two IT areas that Federal Agencies <strong>will</strong> migrate to a shared service model by December 31, 2012 in accordance with OMB guidance.<br />(2) IT Asset Inventory (Appendix 1): a list of IT assets agency-wide to include all IT systems and services that support mission, administrative, and commodity IT programs, using the Federal Enterprise Architecture Reference Model taxonomies provided in the Common Approach. For the August 2012 Enterprise Roadmap submission, this IT Asset Inventory is optional but highly recommended. The IT Asset Inventory <strong>will</strong> be required for Enterprise Roadmaps thereafter.<br />(3) Commodity IT Consolidation Plan (Appendix 2): a synopsis of the agency-wide IT investment portfolio review conducted annually using methods and tools provided in OMB <a href="#not-implemented">M-12-10</a>. For the August 2012 submission, Federal Agencies <strong>will</strong> include their final plan to consolidate commodity IT, as is required by OMB <a href="#not-implemented">M-12-10</a>.<br />(4) Line of Business Service Plan (Appendix 3): the Program Manager of each Federal-wide Line of Business <strong><strong>will</strong> submit</strong> a Plan to OMB via the Managing Partner agency's CIO that addresses increasing the quality and update of the IT shared services that are provided through that LOB by the end of FY 2013. The LOB Plan <strong>will</strong> follow guidance provided in the IT Reform Agenda's 25-Point Plan8 and the IT Shared Services Strategy document that accompanies this memo.</p>
</li>

<p class='context'>Guidance on Inter-Agency Sharing of Personal Data - Protecting Personal Privacy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>With increased focus on data sharing, agencies <strong>must</strong> pay close attention to handling responsibly their own data and the data they share with or receive from other agencies. When information about individuals is involved, agencies <strong>must</strong> pay especially close attention to privacy interests and <strong>must</strong> incorporate measures to safeguard those interests. Prior to any data sharing, agencies <strong>must</strong> review and meet the Privacy Act requirements for computer matching, including developing a computer matching agreement and publishing notice of the proposed match in the�Federal Register; OMB Guidance on Computer Matching (54�Fed. Reg.�25818, June 19, 1989); and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I, "Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals." Agencies <strong>must</strong> also review and meet applicable requirements under other laws, including the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Additional Guidance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>ATTACHMENT: Privacy Principles in Conducting Inter-Agency Data Sharing</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[The following is language from ATTACHMENT: Privacy Principles in Conducting Inter-Agency Data Sharing, follow link for full attachment] <br />6. Minimization.<br />When dealing with paper records, it may be difficult to provide only certain data elements to other agencies, because of the need for manual redaction of other information. In the computer world, it is far easier to implement sharing of only a narrow range of information that is necessary to verify an applicant's eligibility for a program. Agencies <strong>should</strong> analyze what data are needed for program purposes and make every effort to ensure that they transfer only that information.<br /><br />7. Accountability.<br />Data sharing programs <strong>should</strong> include mechanisms to ensure that agencies are accountable for adhering to these principles. Some of these measures are already found in the Privacy Act, which provides for civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Agencies <strong>should</strong> also consider training programs that stress accountability and explain penalties for breaches of confidentiality. Especially for more sensitive data and more extensive data sharing arrangements, agencies <strong>should</strong> consider whether additional oversight mechanisms, such as self-audits, are justified.<br /><br />For example, agencies <strong>should</strong> establish procedures to ensure compliance with redisclosure limitations. One mechanism for assuring compliance would be to have the recipient agency certify on a periodic basis that it has examined practices regarding redisclosure and, if necessary, taken corrective action where improper redisclosures have occurred.<br /><br />8. Privacy Impact Assessments.<br />In the President's FY2001 budget, the President announced an initiative to make "privacy impact assessments," or "PIAs," a regular part of the development of new Government computer systems. A PIA is a plan to build privacy protection into new information systems, such as, for example, by asking systems personnel and program personnel to work through questions on data needs and data protection before the system is developed. The CIO Council has voted the IRS PIA a best practice; it is available as a reference at http://www.cio.gov.</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>Section I. New E-Gov Act Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>A. Agency head responsibilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>are</strong> to use the provisions of the <a href="#not-implemented">E-Government Act</a> and this guidance to interact more successfully with citizens. For example, agencies should continue to use existing guidance, authorities, and procedures to choose IT investments via the agency�s capital planning and investment control process, and to ensure that such investments <strong>are</strong> part of the agency�s blueprint for modernizing its IT architecture (known as the agency�s enterprise architecture).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agency business processes <strong>should</strong> fulfill the needs of citizens, and as such, an agency <strong>should</strong> be willing to reorganize the ways it conducts business transactions with the public in order to accomplish this goal. This may include expanding initiatives that the agency is already undertaking, such as those that are part of the agency�s implementation of the President�s Management Agenda. Any changes to agency business processes <strong>should</strong> further the President�s goal of a citizen centered government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to:<br />� <strong>Define</strong> and <strong>deliver</strong> performance increases that matter to citizens -- Agencies are already required under <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-11</a>, the <a href="#not-implemented">Clinger-Cohen Act</a>, and the <a href="#not-implemented">Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)</a> to establish performance goals for IT and to link such goals to strategic plans. The E-Government Act builds on this process -- agencies <strong>are to</strong> develop performance measures for e-government that are both citizen and productivity-related (see section 202). These performance measures <strong>must</strong> be linked with the agency�s Annual Performance Plan and the agency�s Strategic Plan and used to meet agency objectives, strategic goals, and statutory mandates in E-Government and IT.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to:<br />� Communicate policies within and across agencies � Agencies are already responsible for ensuring that a Chief Information Officer (CIO) oversees the agency�s IT portfolio and identifies opportunities for partnership with other agencies under the <a href="#not-implemented">Clinger Cohen Act</a>. Accordingly, the agency CIO <strong>will</strong> serve as the primary official for assisting agency heads in implementing the E-government Act and this guidance in the agency. In addition, agency heads, through the agency CIO, <strong>will</strong> distribute this guidance throughout the agency.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To carry out this policy [E-government Act], agencies <strong>are expected</strong> to:<br />� Comply with section 508 to ensure accessibility -- The Act requires agencies to continue to comply with section 508 of the <a href="#not-implemented">Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. �794d)</a> in carrying out the provisions of the Act (see section 202(d)).</p>

<p class='context'>B. Agency CIOs.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[...] he agency CIO <strong>will</strong> serve as the primary official for assisting agency heads in implementing the Act and this guidance in the agency. Agency CIOs are already expected to lead work under their agency�s investment review board (IRB) to identify investments that further the agency�s mission and programs in delivering services and information to citizens. In addition, agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> work with the IRB to identify and pursue investments that could be shared across the agency or with other agencies to address similar missions and constituencies. Agency CIOs <strong>should</strong> continue to ensure that e-government investments are reviewed as part of the agency�s budget and capital investment process (i.e., developing a capital asset plan and business case) and that these processes are aligned with the agency�s Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA).</p>

<p class='context'>3. The Role of Other OMB Offices</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Deputy Director for Management <strong>is required</strong> by the Act to chair the Federal CIO Council. The Administrator for E-Government and IT <strong>is required</strong> to work with the Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in areas of shared responsibility. Other offices in OMB <strong>will</strong> be involved in providing guidance and oversight of specific sections of the Act. For example, the head of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy <strong>will</strong> lead OMB�s work on Section 210 regarding the use of share-in-savings contracts for Federal procurements. OMB Resource Management Offices <strong>will</strong> work with the Office of E-Government and IT as they oversee budgetary activities related to E-Government and IT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>A. Annual E-Gov Act Status Report to OMB</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>1. Annual update. The Act requires agencies to provide annual updates on their implementation of the provisions of the Act. Agencies <strong>must</strong> report to OMB each year by December 15th on the following general elements (see section 101, 44 U.S.C. � 3606 and Section 207(e)(4)):<br />a. the status of implementing e-government initiatives,<br />b. how E-Government initiatives have improved performance in delivering programs to constituencies;<br />c. changes to their business processes in order to comply with this guidance and the Act; and<br />d. compliance with other requirements in the Act.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3. The Role of Other OMB Offices</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>2. GPEA. Beginning in FY 2005, agencies <strong>should</strong> provide updates on their continued compliance with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 (GPEA, (P.L. 105-277)) as part of the <a href="#not-implemented">E-Government Act</a> annual status report.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>3. Specific statutory reporting requirements. Agencies that are responsible for specific statutory provisions <strong>may have</strong> separate reporting requirements. Please consult the responsibilities and products outlined in Attachment B [see page 11-13] for additional reporting requirements that may apply to specific agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>4. Support of OMB reports. OMB is also required to report to Congress on several initiatives, and agencies may receive requests from OMB for information about their participation in such areas as the IT Exchange Program and other IT workforce initiatives (Sec 209), use of share-in-savings contracts (Section 210), integration of data elements (Section 212), and community technology centers (Section 213).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. Agencies are also expected to support the following activities:<br />1. The efforts of the Interagency Committee on Government Information (see Section 207) and the Federal Geographic Data Group, as appropriate (see Section 216); and<br />2. As appropriate, select agency activities noted in Section I.A.2 �Requirements of Select Agencies�, as well as activities noted under I.C.1 �The Director of OMB.�</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>III. Existing Activities Authorized by the Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Administrative Offices and Programs. The E-Government Act establishes, in statute, the following:<br />1.

<p class='context'>E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>General Requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This guidance directs agencies to conduct �e-authentication risk assessments� on electronic transactions to ensure that there is a consistent approach across government. (see Attachment A). [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It also provides the public with clearly understood criteria for access to Federal government services online. Attachment B summarizes the public comments received on an earlier version of this guidance. [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34]</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Attachment A</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>1.1.�� Summary</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This guidance <strong>requires</strong> agencies to review new and existing electronic transactions to ensure that authentication processes provide the appropriate level of assurance. It establishes and describes four levels of identity assurance for electronic transactions requiring authentication. Assurance levels also provide a basis for assessing Credential Service Providers (CSPs) on behalf of Federal agencies. This document will assist agencies in determining their e-government authentication needs.  Agency business-process owners bear the primary responsibility to identify assurance levels and strategies for providing them. This responsibility extends to electronic authentication systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> determine assurance levels using the following steps, described in Section 2.3 [ref. Req. 43.20]:<br />Conduct a risk assessment of the e-government system.<br />Map identified risks to the applicable assurance level.<br />Select technology based on e-authentication technical guidance.<br />Validate that the implemented system has achieved the required assurance level.<br />Periodically reassess the system to determine technology refresh requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.2.�� Scope</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] applies to remote authentication of human users of Federal agency IT systems for the purposes of conducting government business electronically (or e- government). Though that authentication typically involves a computer or other electronic device, this guidance does not apply to the authentication of servers, or other machines and network components.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] is intended to help agencies identify and analyze the risks associated with each step of the authentication process. The process includes (but is not limited to) identity proofing, credentialing, technical and administrative management, record keeping, auditing, and use of the credential. Each step of the process influences the technology�s overall conformance to the desired assurance level.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not directly apply to authorization. Authorization focuses on the actions permitted of an identity after authentication has taken place. Decisions concerning authorization are and should remain the purview of the business process owner.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not address issues associated with �intent to sign,� or agency use of authentication credentials as electronic signatures.  For more information on electronic signatures, see the OMB guidance on implementing GPEA1  and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, Pub. L. No. 106-2292.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not identify which technologies should be implemented. The Department of Commerce�s National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing complementary e-authentication technical guidance that agencies will use to identify appropriate technologies, based on the analysis process described here.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This document [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] does not confer, and may not be used to support, any right on behalf of any person or entity against the United States or its agencies or officials.</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.3.�� Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To successfully implement a government service electronically (or e-government), Federal agencies <strong>must</strong> determine the required level of assurance in the authentication for each transaction. This is accomplished through a risk assessment for each transaction. The assessment identifies: risks, and their likelihood of occurrence.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This document expands on Section 5 by instructing agencies how to implement e-authentication processes by outlining a process for assessing risk, describing four levels of identity assurance, and explaining how to determine the appropriate level of identity assurance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>1.4 Applicability</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This guidance [ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] applies to all such transactions for which authentication is required, regardless of the constituency (e.g. individual user, business, or government entity).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2.1</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Level 1:  Little or no confidence in the asserted identity�s validity. Level 2:  Some confidence in the asserted identity�s validity. Level 3:  High confidence in the asserted identity�s validity. Level 4:  Very high confidence in the asserted identity�s validity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2.2.�� Risks, Potential Impacts, and Assurance Levels</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Potential Impact Categories:  To determine the appropriate level of assurance in the user�s asserted identity, agencies must assess the potential risks, and identify measures to minimize their impact. Authentication errors with potentially worse consequences require higher levels of assurance. Business process, policy, and technology may help reduce risk. The risk from an authentication error is a function of two factors: potential harm or impact, and the likelihood of such harm or impact.  Categories of harm and impact include: Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation, Financial loss or agency liability, Harm to agency programs or public interests, Unauthorized release of sensitive information, Personal safety, Civil or criminal violations.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Required assurance levels for electronic transactions are determined by assessing the potential impact of each of the above categories using the potential impact values described in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199, �Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.� The three potential impact values are: Low impact, Moderate impact, High impact.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.03-43.34] Determining Assurance Level: Compare the impact profile from the risk assessment to the impact profiles associated with each assurance level.  To determine the required assurance level, find the lowest level whose impact profile meets or exceeds the potential impact for every category analyzed in the risk assessment (as noted in step 2 below).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In analyzing potential risks, the agency <strong>must</strong> consider all of the potential direct and indirect results of an authentication failure, including the possibility that there will be more than one failure, or harms to more than one person.  The definitions of potential impacts contain some relative terms, like "serious" or "minor," whose meaning will depend on context.  The agency should consider the context and the nature of the persons or entities affected to decide the relative significance of these harms.  Over time, the meaning of these terms will become more definite as agencies gain practical experience with these issues.  The analysis of harms to agency programs or other public interests depends strongly on the context; the agency should consider these issues with care.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 43.15-43.18] In some cases impact may correspond to multiple assurance levels. In such cases, agencies <strong>should</strong> use the context to determine the appropriate assurance level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2.3 Determining Assurance Levels and selecting authentication solutions using Risk Assessment</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 1:  Conduct a risk assessment of the e-government system.  Guidance for agencies in conducting risk assessments is available in A-130, Section 5 of OMB�s GPEA guidance and existing NIST guidance. The risk assessment will measure the relative severity of the potential harm and likelihood of occurrence of a wide range of impacts (to any party) associated with the e-government system in the event of an identity authentication error.<br />Note: An E-government system may have multiple categories or types of transactions, which may require separate analysis within the overall risk assessment.  An E-government system may also span multiple agencies whose activities may require separate consideration.<br />Risk analysis is to some extent a subjective process, in which agencies must consider harms that might result from, among other causes, technical failures, malevolent third parties, public misunderstandings, and human error.  Agencies should consider a wide range of possible scenarios in seeking to determine what potential harms are associated with their business process.  It is better to be over-inclusive than under-inclusive in conducting this analysis.  Once risks have been identified, there may also be ways to adjust the business process to mitigate particular risks by reducing the likelihood that they will occur (see Step 4).<br />Step 2:  Map identified risks to the required assurance level.  The risk assessment should be summarized in terms of the potential impact categories in Section 2.2.<br />To determine the required assurance level, agencies should initially identify risks inherent in the transaction process, regardless of its authentication technology.  Agencies should then tie the potential impact category outcomes to the authentication level, choosing the lowest level of authentication that will cover all of potential impacts identified.  Thus, if five categories of potential impact are appropriate for Level 1, and one category of potential impact is appropriate for Level 2, the transaction would require a Level 2 authentication.  For example, if the misuse of a user�s electronic identity/credentials during a medical procedure presents a risk of serious injury or death, map to the risk profile identified under Level 4, even if other consequences are minimal.<br /><br />Step 3:  Select technology based on the NIST e-authentication technical guidance. After determining the assurance level, the agency should refer to the NIST e-authentication<br /> <br />technical guidance to identify and implement the appropriate technical requirements.<br /><br />Step 4: After implementation, validate that the information system has operationally achieved the required assurance level.  Because some implementations may create or compound particular risks, conduct a final validation to confirm that the system achieves the required assurance level for the user-to-agency process. The agency should validate that the authentication process satisfies the systems�s authentication requirements as part of required security procedures (e.g., certification and accreditation).<br /><br />Step 5: Periodically reassess the information system to determine technology refresh requirements.  The agency must periodically reassess the information system to ensure that the identity authentication requirements continue to be valid as a result of technology changes or changes to the agency�s business processes. Annual information security assessment requirements provide an excellent opportunity for this. Agencies may adjust the identity credential�s level of assurance using additional risk mitigation measures. Easing identity credential assurance level requirements may increase the size of the enabled customer pool, but agencies must ensure that this does not corrupt the system�s choice of the appropriate assurance level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2.5 Scope and Elements of Risk</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Section 9c of OMB�s GPEA guidance states agencies <strong>should</strong> plan how to minimize this risk by ensuring user approval of such information. Section 8c of the OMB Procedures and Guidance on Implementing GPEA includes guidance on minimizing the likelihood of repudiation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Legal issues can present significant policy challenges for agencies. Agencies <strong>should</strong> consider these issues when assigning transactions to assurance levels. Risk assessments <strong>should</strong> include the potential effects of illegal activities and process failures with respect to: agency enforcement priorities, agency programmatic interests, broader public interests such as national security, the environment, and economic markets.Some of these harms (e.g., financial loss or release of personal information) are described in each assurance level; others depend on the agency's programmatic interests. The risk analysis process is necessarily highly contextual, and agencies <strong>should</strong> consider whether their systems present any distinctive risks.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The risk analysis incorporates this by discussing the risks associated with criminal and civil violations, and harm to agency programs or the public interest. Agencies <strong>should</strong> remember to consult appropriately with their counsel's office in their determination of this impact. When assessing this risk and designing a process, agencies <strong>should</strong> consider single acts and patterns of action that could affect agency programs. For example, if sensitive information is available from an agency website, the agency <strong>should</strong> consider the effects of single acts and possible patterns of such activity when assessing risk levels. (18 U.S.C. 1029, 1030)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>are expected to</strong> follow all relevant guidance issued by the National Achieves and Records Administration (NARA) regarding the handling of electronic records. This guidance addresses implementation issues further in section 4.1 [ref. Req. 43.24].</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3. Assessing Confidence in Credential Service Providers</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The CSP�s issuance and maintenance policy influences its e-authentication process trustworthiness. The E-Authentication Initiative <strong>will</strong> therefore develop an assessment process for the government to determine the maximum assurance level merited by the CSP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4.1. The E-Authentication Process</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To determine the level of credential required to validate a user�s identity, an agency <strong>must</strong> understand how its business applications process the credential. The agency <strong>must</strong> identify the requirements for each step in the e-authentication (and authorization) process. This includes the following steps: Initial enrollment, Subsequent visits to agency application, Verification of identity credential, Transaction management, Long term records management, Periodic system tests, Suspension, revocation, re-issuanc Audit. Each step is explained in the e-authentication technical guidance.  Responsibility for these steps lies with the business process owner, designated agency, or cross-agency authority.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4.2.�� Using Anonymous Credentials</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>These anonymous credentials have limited application and are to be implemented on a case- by-case basis. Some people may have anonymous and identity credentials. As general matter, anonymous credentials are appropriate for Levels 1 and 2 only.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4.3.�� Information Sharing and the Privacy Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When developing authentication processes, agencies <strong>must</strong> satisfy the requirements for managing security in the collection and storage of information associated with validating user identities. The <a href="#not-implemented">E-Government Act of 2002,</a> section 208 requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments for electronic information systems and collections. This includes performing an assessment when authentication technology is added to an electronic<br />information system accessed by members of the public. For additional information on privacy impact assessments, consult OMB guidance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To the extent that the authentication process captures information that is protected by the <a href="#not-implemented">Privacy Act</a> (because it is information about an individual that the agency retrieves by an individual's name or other identifier and thus is maintained in an agency <a href="#not-implemented">Privacy Act</a> system of records), the agency needs to comply with the <a href="#not-implemented">Privacy Act</a> with respect to such information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Authentication data <strong>must</strong> be protected from unauthorized disclosure or modification. The Privacy Act generally requires that registered users be allowed to have access to and request amendment to information about them maintained in a system of records. Information from the system of records should not be shared, except in accordance with the Privacy Act and other applicable laws.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4.4  4.4. Cost/Benefit Considerations</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In some cases initial capital cost may be small, with higher long-term maintenance cost. It is therefore important to assess the costs over the life cycle of the system. Authentication errors can result in significant costs to agencies and the public. These costs will be identified by the risk analysis set forth in section 2, and should be included in any cost/benefit analysis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Overly burdensome systems may affect non-federal entities� use of the system diminishing anticipated benefits and lowering return on investment. If a technical solution for an assurance level is too costly or burdensome, agencies <strong>should</strong> consider reducing the required assurance level and implementing management controls or business process adjustments to achieve the same level of assurance. If the cost cannot be reduced to an acceptable level through such risk mitigation approaches, then the agency may need to reconsider its vision for the e-authentication system.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Higher assurance levels may require more costly credentials. Minimizing the number of credentials can reduce costs. Refer to Section 3 of the GPEA guidance for additional information on assessing risks, costs, and benefits. The e-authentication technical guidance will provide alternatives for addressing assurance levels, which may help agencies to better manage authentication costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>5. Effective Dates of Guidance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> categorize all existing transactions/systems requiring user authentication into one of the described assurance levels by September 15, 2005.</p>

<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />At least thirty days before GSA expects to award a SmartBuy contract for a category of software, GSA <strong>will</strong> notify all agencies they should, to the extent possible, postpone all further purchase requirements until the SmartBuy contract is awarded.  Agencies <strong>may</strong> ask GSA for a waiver for compelling needs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />Upon award of the SmartBuy contract, agencies <strong>must</strong> review the SmartBuy contract to determine whether it satisfies their needs and, absent a compelling justification for doing otherwise, agencies <strong>shall</strong> acquire their software requirements from the SmartBuy contract.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br /> If an agency has contracts for software from the list of ten SmartBuy opportunities, or in the areas of human resources, financial management, and grants, that do not have yearly options, the agency <strong>shall</strong> seek to renegotiate the contracts to include yearly options beginning October 1, 2004, so as to allow for an easy transition to a SmartBuy contract.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 44.03] <br />Agencies <strong>may</strong> procure software other than through the SmartBuy contract in situations where a compelling justification exists.  The agency <strong>needs to</strong> prepare a memorandum setting forth the compelling justification, which <strong>needs to</strong> be signed by both the agency�s SPE and CIO.  After approval by the SPE and the CIO, the justification <strong>shall</strong> be sent to GSA with a copy to the OMB E-Government Administrator, at least 30 days prior to the expected award of the affected SmartBuy contract.  The justification <strong>shall</strong> specify why the SPE and the CIO have concluded use of the SmartBuy contract is not in the best interest of the agency, including specific and quantifiable reasons.  GSA, after coordination with the OMB E-Government Administrator, <strong>will</strong> respond to the agency before award of the SmartBuy contract.</p>

<p class='context'>Information Technology (IT) Project Manager (PM) Qualification Guidance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to ensuring PMs are appropriately qualified, this quarter's e-Gov management scorecard requires agencies to submit to OMB by July 30th, a plan to meet (i.e., implement and achieve) the CIO Council guidance [issued in the FY 2005 Budget Guidance]. Your plans <strong>should</strong> document your approach, milestones and schedule for meeting budget guidance. Further, the plans <strong>should</strong> be coordinated with your Chief Human Capital Officers, please follow OPM�s Workforce Planning Model (www.opm.gov/workforceplanning/) and the OPM Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework (http://apps.opm.gov/HumanCapital/tool/index.cfm). <strong>Complete</strong> the attached summary table as part of your plan.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For the FY 2006 budget submission, agencies <strong>should</strong> use section I.D. of budget exhibit 300 to identify the required PM Level for each investment (e.g., does the project require a Level 1, 2 or 3 PM), and whether the assigned PM's qualifications have been validated against the CIO Council guidance. If the PM is in the process of being validated, or cannot be validated at the appropriate project level at this time, you <strong>should</strong> explain how (e.g., training, mentoring) and when the validation will be completed.</p>

<p class='context'>Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Overall, the management of agencies' public websites <strong>should</strong> be in compliance with Federal information resource management law and policy.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>must</strong> manage Federal agency public websites as part of their information resource management program following guidance in OMB Circular A-130, OMB �Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies� (67 FR 5365), this memorandum, and other information policy issuances.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OMB expects prompt and orderly implementation of the policies in this memorandum and its attachment.  OMB expects agencies to become fully compliant with new requirements by 12/31/05 and continue to adhere to existing requirements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>1. Establish and Maintain Information Dissemination Product Inventories, Priorities, and  Schedules</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Your agency is already required under <a href="#not-implemented">OMB Circular A-130</a> and the <a href="#not-implemented">Paperwork Reduction Act</a> to disseminate information to the public in a timely, equitable, efficient, and appropriate manner and to maintain inventories of information dissemination products.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. Section 207 of the E-Government Act requires your agency to develop priorities and schedules for making Government information available and accessible to the public, in accordance with public comment, and to post this information on your agency�s website.  Section 207 also requires your agency to report to OMB, as part of the agency�s annual E-Government Act report, the final determinations of inventories, priorities, and schedules your agency has made.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>C. Your agency <strong>must</strong> also post to your agency�s website any updates to your agency�s final determination of inventories, priorities, and schedules, and include this information in your agency�s annual <a href="#not-implemented">E-Government Act</a> report.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2. Ensure Information Quality</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Your agency is already <strong>required</strong> under the Information Quality Act and associated guidelines to maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information and services provided to the public. This includes making information and services available on a timely and equitable basis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. Agencies <strong>must</strong> reasonably assure suitable information and service quality, consistent with the level of importance of the information.  Reasonable steps include: 1) clearly identifying the limitations inherent in the information dissemination product (e.g., possibility of errors, degree of reliability, and validity) so users are fully aware of the quality and integrity of the information or service, 2) taking reasonable steps to remove the limitations inherent in the information, and 3) reconsidering delivery of the information or services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3. Establish and Enforce Agency-wide Linking Policies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A.�Agencies <strong>must</strong> now establish and enforce explicit agency-wide linking policies describing management controls for linking within and beyond the agency.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. These [Linking policies] policies <strong>must</strong> appropriately limit external linking to information or services necessary for the proper performance of an agency function.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>C. Agency linking policies <strong>must</strong> also include reasonable management controls to assure external links remain active or otherwise continue to provide the level of quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) as intended by the agency and expected by users.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[D.] When an agency determines external links are necessary for and material to the presentation of agency information or the delivery of services in the proper performance of an agency function, they <strong>must</strong> take reasonable steps to ensure the presentation is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>E. Agencies <strong>must</strong> reasonably assure suitable information and service quality, consistent with the level of importance of the information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[E.] Agency links to commercial organizations or interest groups present special challenges with respect to maintaining agency objectivity and thus <strong>must</strong> be used judiciously.</p>

<p>A. You <strong>are</strong> already <strong>required</strong> under OMB <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-130</a> to assist the public in locating government information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. You <strong>must</strong> now ensure your agency�s principal public website and any major entry point include a search function.  However, agencies may determine in limited circumstances (e.g., for small websites) site maps or subject indexes are more effective than a typical search function.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>C. By December 31, 2005, this search function [on agency's public website] <strong>should</strong>, to the extent practicable and necessary to achieve intended purposes, permit searching of all files intended for public use on the website, display search results in order of relevancy to search criteria, and provide response times appropriately equivalent to industry best practices.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>D. By December 31, 2005, agency public websites <strong>should</strong> to the extent practicable and necessary to achieve intended purposes, provide all data in an open, industry standard format permitting users to aggregate, disaggregate, or otherwise manipulate and analyze the data to meet their needs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>E. Agencies <strong>should</strong> note the Interagency Committee on Government Information has provided to OMB recommendations for organizing, categorizing, and searching for government information.  By December 17, 2005, OMB will issue any necessary additional policies in this area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>6. Use Approved Domains</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A. Your agency <strong>must</strong> use only .gov, .mil, or Fed.us domains unless the agency head explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an agency function.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>B. This requirement recognizes the proper performance of agency functions includes an obligation for clear and unambiguous public notification of the agency's involvement in or sponsorship of its information dissemination products including public websites.  It also recognizes in certain limited circumstances other domains may be necessary for the proper performance of an agency function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>7. Implement Security Controls</p>

<p class='context'>Requested Agency Actions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Identify Impacted Investments</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Leveraging the work performed in support of the EGov/LoB Implementation Plans, agencies are to <strong>identify</strong> IT investments being (or planned to be) modified, replaced, or retired due to agency use of an E-Gov or LoB initiative. Examples include legacy payroll systems being retired due to migration to the E-Payroll initiative and legacy travel systems being replaced due to migration to an E-Travel service provider. Agencies <strong>should</strong> also consult their E-Gov/LoB Implementation Plans, Exhibit 53s, and Exhibit 300s to <strong>identify</strong> investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Develop Baseline Cost Estimates</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By September 30, 2006, agencies are to <strong><strong>develop</strong></strong> a comprehensive baseline cost estimate for each investment identified. <strong>Use</strong> the guidelines in the IT Investment Cost Measurement Framework (Attachment A) to <strong><strong>develop</strong></strong> baseline cost estimates. Baseline cost estimates should include only current and planned/future costs associated with the identified investments � exclude costs associated with the <strong>use</strong> of the related E-Gov/LoB initiatives (e.g., migration costs, service fees). <strong>Submit</strong> the cost estimate to OMB using the Baseline Cost Reporting template (Attachment B). a. The IT Investment Cost Measurement Framework is intended to help agencies identify the full cost of performance to the government of an agency project or investment, including sufficient detail on the basis of the costs, and was developed based on the guidance and cost principles in Attachment C of OMB Circular A-76.2 b. Agencies should complete a separate template for each investment identified. Based on our experience with pilot projects, we anticipate it will take approximately 45 days to <strong><strong>develop</strong></strong> baseline costs using the framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Measure Costs</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Once baseline cost estimates for the identified investments are developed, agencies <strong>should</strong> begin measuring actual costs of those investments on an ongoing basis. We expect agencies to begin all cost measurement activities no later than September 30, 2006. Per OMB Memorandum <a href="#not-implemented">M-05-23,</a> agencies <strong>should</strong> already be managing and measuring projects to within ten percent of baseline goals through use of an EVM System compliant with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA STD-748 or, for steady-state projects, performing operational analyses.</p>

<p class='context'>COST OF WORK (GOVERNMENT-PERFORMED)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In determining the cost of government-performed work, please distinguish between work performed directly by the agency and work performed by another government organization on a �fee-for-service� basis (e.g., a shared service center). Within the Baseline Cost Reporting template, use the �(Government) Agency� column to indicate work performed directly by the agency and the �(Government) Service Fees� column to indicate work performed on a �fee-for service� basis. Additionally, for work performed on a �fee-for-service� basis, please indicate the service provider, the associated agency, and the methodology and algorithm for determining the service fee (e.g., fee per employee, fee per transaction, etc.).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Personnel costs are costs associated with all personnel fully or partially involved in the project and include the following categories: � Direct Labor � Labor attributed specifically to a project � Indirect Labor � Labor in support of but not directly attributable to a project.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In determining labor costs, <strong>identify</strong> project staff and the associated wage/grade classifications and salary. <strong>Use</strong> actual resources assigned to the project, including both recurring and nonrecurring workload. As appropriate, account for labor rate escalation and inflation. (Based on Sections B.2.a, B.2.k, and B.2.l of Circular A-76, Attachment C).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Account</strong> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Prorated Labor � Personnel not 100% dedicated to the project are to be accounted for as part of total project labor costs. Prorate the cost of those personnel based on the amount of time they spend on the project. For calculation purposes, <strong>use</strong> either the actual hours or percentage of time spent on the project. (Based on Section B.2.b)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Account</strong> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Fringe Benefits � Fringe benefits include retirement, insurance and health, Medicare, and miscellaneous benefit cost factors. The actual costs of these benefit cost factors should not be calculated separately; rather, <strong>apply</strong> the standard fringe benefit rate of 32.85% to full and part-time labor positions� basic pay. Fringe benefits are not applied to temporary and intermittent civilian positions. For positions not covered by Civil Servant Retirement System or Federal Employee Retirement System (typically intermittent and temporary employees), <strong>apply</strong> the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) cost factor of 7.65%. (Based on Section B.2.f)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Account</strong> for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Personnel Liability Insurance � The cost of personnel liability insurance is calculated by multiplying the total personnel-related costs, including fringe benefits, by 0.7%. (Based on Section B.4.f) 2 ATTACHMENT A - IT INVESTMENT COST MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK AUGUST 2006</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Account for the following in developing direct and indirect labor costs: [ref. Reqs. 55.07-55.10] <br />� Overhead Factor � <strong>Calculate</strong> overhead by multiplying personnel costs, including fringe benefits (but not including the personnel liability insurance factor), by a standard overhead factor of 12%. (Based on Section B.5). To avoid double-counting of costs, do not <strong>apply</strong> the full 12% overhead rate if any of your overhead costs are captured in your indirect labor and/or material and supply costs. Instead, please determine an alternate agency-specific overhead rate to account for all overhead costs not included in another cost category. Please document your rationale/methodology for determining this alternate overhead rate.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Material and supply costs <strong>include</strong> all equipment (e.g., hardware, software) and supplies required by the investment. Please distinguish between the following: <br />� Existing Assets � <strong>Include</strong> the current value (depreciated as appropriate) of all materials and supplies. Additionally, <strong>provide</strong> an overview of the project lifecycle, indicating where the asset is in the project lifecycle. If an asset was not purchased by the project, but acquired on a different basis, please indicate the basis and account for costs accordingly. (Based on Sections B.3 and B.4) <br />� Planned Acquisitions � <strong>Include</strong> all planned acquisitions in materials and supply costs (e.g., hardware replacements, software license upgrades) required over the lifecycle of the project. <strong>Provide</strong> the methodology or basis used to determine the value of the planned acquisitions. (Based on Sections B.3 and B.4).</p>

<p class='context'>COST OF WORK (CONTRACTOR PERFORMED)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The costing elements and descriptions as outlined in Section 3 apply to contractor-performed work as well.

The credential will be tested by GSA who will provide test results and report any configuration problems requiring correction to the agency within three weeks of receipt. <strong>Should</strong> configuration problems exist, the agency must resubmit their standard credential for re-testing once required corrections are made. The resubmission <strong>should</strong> be within three weeks of receiving the initial test results from GSA. Otherwise, the agency needs to be able to demonstrate substantial progress is being made to address any test failures. Agencies <strong>should</strong> consider not issuing new credentials until all problems identified in testing are resolved.<br />The initial testing services are being provided by GSA at no cost to the agency. However, agencies may be responsible for reimbursing GSA if substantial GSA support is necessary to help agencies resolve any technical issues. Agencies not using a shared service program <strong>should</strong> access the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program website at http://fips201ep.cio.gov/dce.php for directions on submitting test credentials and necessary information to GSA for testing.</p>

<p class='context'>Quarterly status reports</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning March 1, 2007 and each quarter thereafter, agencies <strong>will</strong> post to their federal agency public website a report on the number of PIV credentials issued. Agencies must use the attached report template to distinguish between credentials issued to employees, contractors, and others (e.g., visiting scientists). The website address should be provided to OMB at eauth@omb.eop.gov by the due date. For agencies using GSA or Interior shared services, you may elect to have your service provider post your quarterly status to their public website.</p>

<p class='context'>Update on the Trusted Internet Connections Initiative</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Background</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In November 2007, OMB announced the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative to optimize individual agency network services into a common solution for the Federal government. Agencies were required to develop and submit comprehensive Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to reduce and consolidate the number of external access points, including Internet connections; and ensure that all external connections are routed through an OMBapproved TIC. <br /><br />Based on solicited agency Statements of Capability, OMB also designated twenty agencies as TIC Access Providers (TICAPS). Each TICAP agency was authorized two locations where they <strong>must</strong> reduce and consolidate all external connections. Agencies <strong>must</strong> present an evidence-based rationale for acquisition of more than two locations. Please send an email to tic@dhs.gov for the template and instructions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Specific Actions Requested</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> update and report formal Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) to the Department of Homeland Security by September 25, 2009, and provide updated status to DHS every six months thereafter, until completed. <br /><br />All agencies seeking Trusted Internet Connection Access Provider (TICAP) services <strong>shall</strong> utilize the template in enclosure (1) and submit it to tic@dhs.gov. For reference by TICAP agencies only, a blank TICAP agency POA&M is provided in enclosure (2). DHS has separately contacted the 20 TICAP agencies with instructions on how to update their POA&Ms. <br /><br />In addition to the POA&M, TICAP agencies must schedule by September 25, 2009 their initial TIC compliance on-site assessments with DHS. All other agencies must also collaborate with DHS to complete their initial TIC compliance self-assessments by December 31, 2009. <br /><br />Federal policy requires all agencies to undertake immediate responsibility for executing essential agreements and updating POA&Ms to facilitate not only TIC preparations, but also due diligence for integrating the National Cyber Protection System (NCPS, operationally referred to as Einstein) deployments and synchronizing with US-CERT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Specific Actions Requested</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>will</strong> work with DHS on studies of Federal network infrastructure, and report data from the agency�s inventory of network connections to DHS as requested. Each agency is responsible for maintaining a current inventory of its network connections, including details on the service provider, cost, capacity and traffic volume for each connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Specific Actions Requested</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies that are seeking service through the Networx contract vehicle <strong>will</strong> work with the General Services Administration (GSA) to estimate costs of adopting the MTIPS option by September 30, 2009. Please contact GSA at (866) 472-0274.</p>

<p class='context'>Open Government Directive</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Publish Government Information Online</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To increase accountability, promote informed participation by the public, and create economic opportunity, each agency <strong>shall</strong> take prompt steps to expand access to information by making it available online in open formats.   With respect to information, the presumption <strong>shall</strong> be in favor of openness (to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> respect the presumption of openness by publishing information online (in addition to any other planned or mandated publication methods) and by preserving and maintaining electronic information, consistent with the Federal Records Act and other applicable law and policy. Timely publication of information is an essential component of transparency. Delays <strong>should</strong> not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable consequence of high demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>b</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the extent practicable and subject to valid restrictions, agencies <strong>should</strong> publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>c</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the extent practical and subject to valid restrictions, agencies <strong>should</strong> proactively use modern technology to disseminate useful information, rather than waiting for specific requests under FOIA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>d</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 45 days, each agency <strong>shall</strong> identify and publish online in an open format at least three high-value data sets (see attachment section 3.a.i) and register those data sets via Data.gov. These must be data sets not previously available online or in a downloadable format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>e</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days, each agency <strong>shall</strong> create an Open Government Webpage located at http://www.[agency].gov/open to serve as the gateway for agency activities related to the Open Government Directive and <strong>shall</strong> maintain and update that webpage in a timely fashion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>f</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Open Government Webpage <strong>shall</strong> incorporate a mechanism for the public to: i. Give feedback on and assessment of the quality of published information; ii. Provide input about which information to prioritize for publication; and iii. Provide input on the agency�s Open Government Plan (see 3.a.).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p class='context'>h</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong>shall</strong> publish its annual Freedom of Information Act Report in an open format on its Open Government Webpage in addition to any other planned dissemination methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>i</p>

<ul>

<p class='context'>Improve the Quality of Government Information</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To improve the quality of government information available to the public, senior leaders <strong>should</strong> make certain that the information conforms to OMB guidance on information quality and that adequate systems and processes are in place within the agencies to promote such conformity.  (Footnote: Information Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-554, section 515; see also, "Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies" (67 FR 8452) and your agency's Information Quality Act guidelines.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 45 days, each agency, in consultation with OMB, <strong>shall</strong> designate a high-level senior official to be accountable for the quality and objectivity of, and internal controls over, the Federal spending information publicly disseminated through such public venues as USAspending.gov or other similar websites. The official <strong>shall</strong> participate in the agency�s Senior Management Council, or similar governance structure, for the agency-wide internal control assessment pursuant to the Federal Managers� Financial Integrity Act.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>b</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB will issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a framework for the quality of Federal spending information publicly disseminated through such public venues as USAspending.gov or other similar websites. The framework <strong>shall</strong> require agencies to submit plans with details of the internal controls implemented over information quality, including system and process changes, and the integration of these controls within the agency�s existing infrastructure. An assessment will later be made as to whether additional guidance on implementing OMB guidance on information quality is necessary to cover other types of government information disseminated to the public.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>c</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 120 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB <strong>will</strong> issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a longer-term comprehensive strategy for Federal spending transparency, including the Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act and the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. This guidance <strong>will</strong> identify the method for agencies to report quarterly on their progress toward improving their information quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Create and Institutionalize a Culture of Open Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To create an unprecedented and sustained level of openness and accountability in every agency, senior leaders <strong>should</strong> strive to incorporate the values of transparency, participation, and collaboration into the ongoing work of their agency. Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the Government � such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations � to work together to define and to develop open government solutions. Integration of various disciplines facilitates organization-wide and lasting change in the way that Government works.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 120 days, each agency <strong>shall</strong> develop and publish on its Open Government Webpage an Open Government Plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities. Additional details on the required content of this plan are attached. Each agency�s<br />plan <strong>shall</strong> be updated every two years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>b</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days, the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Federal Chief Technology Officer <strong>shall</strong> create an Open Government Dashboard on www.whitehouse.gov/open. The Open Government Dashboard will make available each agency�s Open Government Plan, together with aggregate statistics and visualizations designed to provide an assessment of the state of open government in the Executive Branch and progress over time toward meeting the deadlines for action outlined in this Directive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>c</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 45 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB, the Federal Chief Information Officer, and the Federal Chief Technology Officer <strong>will</strong> establish a working group that focuses on transparency, accountability, participation, and collaboration within the Federal Government. This group, with senior level representation from program and management offices throughout the Government, <strong>will</strong> serve several critical functions, including: <br />i. Providing a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote transparency, including system and process solutions for information collection, aggregation, validation, and dissemination; <br />ii. Coordinating efforts to implement existing mandates for Federal spending transparency, including the Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act and the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act; and <br />iii. Providing a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote participation and collaboration, including how to experiment with new technologies, take advantage of the expertise and insight of people both inside and outside the Federal Government, and form high-impact collaborations with researchers, the private sector, and civil society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>d</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 90 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB <strong>will</strong> issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a framework for how agencies can use challenges, prizes, and other incentive-backed strategies to find innovative or cost-effective solutions to improving open government.</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>Create an Enabling Policy Framework for Open Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this Directive <strong>shall</strong> be construed to supersede existing requirements for review and clearance of pre-decisional information by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to legislative, budgetary, administrative, and regulatory materials. Moreover, nothing in this Directive <strong>shall</strong> be construed to suggest that the presumption of openness precludes the legitimate protection of information whose release would threaten national security, invade personal privacy, breach confidentiality, or damage other genuinely compelling interests.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>a</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 120 days, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), in consultation with the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Federal Chief Technology Officer, <strong>will</strong> review existing OMB policies, such as Paperwork Reduction Act guidance and privacy guidance, to identify impediments to open government and to the use of new technologies and, where necessary, issue clarifying guidance and/or propose revisions to such policies, to promote greater openness in government.</p>

<p class='context'>Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Policy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Potential Benefits of Prizes</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Administration believes that prizes and challenges have a number of potential benefits. Under the right circumstances, they may allow government to: <br />Establish an important goal without having to choose the approach or the team that is most likely to succeed; Pay only for results; Highlight excellence in particular domain of human endeavor to motivate, inspire, and guide others; Increase the number and diversity of the individuals, organizations, and teams that are addressing a particular problem or challenge of national or international significance; <br />Improve the skills of the participants in the competition; Stimulate private sector investment that is many times greater than the cash value of the prize; <br />Further a Federal agency's mission by attracting more interest and  attention to a defined program, activity, or issue of concern, and Capture the public imagination and change the public's perception of what is possible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <strong>encourage</strong> agencies to: <br />Identify and proactively address legal, regulatory, technical, and other barriers to the use of prizes and challenges;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <strong>encourage</strong> agencies to: <br />Select one or more individuals to identify and implement prizes and challenges, potentially in partnership with outside organizations, and to participate in a government- wide �community of practice� led by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is Administration policy to strongly <strong>encourage</strong> agencies to: <br />Increase their capacity to support, design, and manage prizes, potentially in collaboration with external partners.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To support agencies in the execution of prizes that further the policy objectives of the Federal Government, the Administration <strong>will</strong> make available a web-based platform for prizes and challenges within 120 days. This platform <strong>will</strong> provide a forum for agencies to post problems and invite communities of problem solvers to suggest, collaborate on, and deliver solutions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Over the longer term, the General Services Administration (GSA) <strong>will</strong> also provide government-wide services to share best practices and assist agencies in developing guidelines for issuing challenges.  Additionally, GSA <strong>will</strong> develop, as expeditiously as possible, a contract vehicle to provide agency access to relevant products and services, including technical assistance in structuring and conducting contests to take maximum benefit of the marketplace as they identify and pursue contest initiatives to further the policy objectives of the Federal Government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In considering the use of prizes and challenges, agencies <strong>should</strong> have a clear idea of what they are trying to accomplish by supporting or encouraging the creation of a prize, and how the prize will help them achieve that goal. A prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring private innovation and change. Furthermore, agencies <strong>should</strong> plan appropriately for all stages of prize development and, where permissible, consider partnering with other entities that might administer, support, or catalyze the prize.</p>

<p class='context'>Use of Prizes and Challenges � Policy Issues for Consideration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In considering the use of prizes and challenges, agencies <strong>should</strong> have a clear idea of what they are trying to accomplish by supporting or encouraging the creation of a prize, and how the prize will help them achieve that goal.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Choose the Right Prize for the Goal</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exemplar prizes, such as the Nobel Prize, define excellence within an area. Historically, most prizes have been exemplar prizes that recognize past general achievement in a field, but other prize designs may more effectively spur future innovation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Point solution prizes aim to reward and spur development of solutions for a particular, well-defined problem. NASA, for example, is using an online �innovation marketplace� with 180,000 participants to spur solutions to problems such as forecasting solar activity, keeping food fresh in space, and developing a compact aerobic device for astronauts. An advance market commitment may be one vehicle for spurring specific solutions by providing a commitment to purchase a product that does not yet exist. In the private sector, for example, five governments and the Gates Foundation have pledged $1.5 billion to support the purchase of pneumococcal vaccines for children in developing countries, which could save the lives of 7 million children by 2030.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exposition prizes help identify and promote a broad range of promising ideas and practices that may not otherwise attract attention, facilitating further development of the idea or practice by third parties. Successful exposition prizes can mobilize capital and institutions in support of ideas and practices developed during a prize competition. For example, the Director of National Intelligence sponsors the Galileo Award to encourage Federal employees to propose creative solutions for the Intelligence Community, and provides winners with a cash prize and the opportunity to brief senior officials on their ideas.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Network prizes build networks and strengthen communities by organizing winners into new problem-solving communities that can deliver more impact than individual efforts. One example would be a contest encouraging people worldwide to share their thoughts and ideas on a variety of topics of universal interest and then organizing participants into an active online community, creating a global, cross-cultural dialogue in furtherance of the public diplomacy mission of the United States.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Participation prizes create value during and after the competition � not through conferral of the prize award itself but through their role in encouraging contestants to change their behavior or develop new skills that may have beneficial effects during and beyond the competition. As part of his �Educate to Innovate� campaign, for example, President Obama has highlighted the FIRST robotics competitions, which engage over 200,000 students, and are designed to motivate young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. A contest encouraging good nutrition on the part of school cafeterias or school children would be an example of a participation prize; contestants participate not necessarily to collect the reward, but for the fun and benefits of the competition itself.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As noted, a prize <strong>should</strong> not be an end in itself, but one means within a broader strategy for spurring change. When considering prizes, agencies <strong>should</strong> select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Market stimulation prizes try to establish the viability of a market to address a potential market failure, mobilize additional human talent and financial capital to jumpstart the development of a new industry, or change public perceptions about what is possible. The goal of the Ansari X Prize, for example, was to serve as a catalyst for the private spaceflight industry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Focus on All Stages of the Prize, including Pre-Prize and Post-Prize Stages</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> plan appropriately for all stages of prize development and administration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies also <strong>should</strong> plan for the post-prize phase, reinforcing the impact of an award with other investments and follow-up activities.  In some cases, it may be helpful and appropriate to increase the visibility of a prize by involving senior agency officials in the launch.  It may be further helpful in some instances for an agency to identify government actions that would increase the impact of the prize over the long-term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Choose the Right Vehicles and Partners for the Prize</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> think broadly about the role that effective partners can play in administering or publicizing contests.  It may be appropriate, where legally permissible, to seek Federal agency or non-federal partners to help meet agency goals.  Some or all of the following vehicles may, in appropriate circumstances, be worthy of consideration: Designing, administering, and paying for the prize internally within the agency; Providing a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract to an outside organization that covers some or all of the costs associated with the prize purse and prize administration; or Encouraging the formation of a public-private partnership to fund and administer a prize.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Potential Legal Authority � Issues for Consideration</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies considering prizes and competitions <strong>should</strong> consult with their general counsels concerning legal issues relevant to their agencies and to ensure that each use of a prize or competition is consistent with congressional authorization or appropriation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Grants and Cooperative Agreements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some agencies have authority to award grants and/or participate in cooperative agreements and may be able conduct prize competitions though that authority. A �grant� is defined in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (and in OMB Circulars) as financial assistance by the Federal Government that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose; a �cooperative agreement� is similarly defined, with the additional criterion that the agency expects to have substantial involvement with the recipient in carrying out the activities contemplated in the agreement. Neither instrument may be used to acquire goods or services for the direct use or benefit of the Federal Government, such as to conduct an agency�s own prize contest; agencies <strong>must</strong> use procurement contracts for that purpose.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accordingly, where grants or cooperative agreements are appropriate mechanisms under a given statute to distribute funds, then a �cash prize for a competition� <strong>could</strong> potentially also be a type of grant or the subject of a cooperative agreement that <strong>could</strong> be used if otherwise consistent with the specific authorizing statute for the grant.  Discretionary, competitive grant programs (in contrast to formula grants or block grants) may be best suited as vehicles for prize competitions, since discretionary, competitive grants are often authorized by statutes that do not specify the manner in which grant funds must be distributed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As part of their consideration of using grants to facilitate prize competitions, agencies <strong>may</strong> examine their authority to make fixed obligation awards without requirements for Federal monitoring of actual costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Necessary Expense Doctrine</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An agency without explicit prize authority might be able to conduct a contest and/or offer a prize if doing so bears a direct relationship to the agency�s statutorily authorized mission.  Agencies <strong>should</strong> consult their general counsels to determine whether such a relationship exists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Under the �necessary expense� doctrine, an agency <strong>has</strong> reasonable discretion in determining how to carry out the objects of an appropriation. To qualify as a �necessary expense,� the expenditure must:  <br />(1) <strong>make</strong> a direct contribution to carrying out either a specific appropriation or an authorized agency function for which more general appropriations are available; <br />(2) not be prohibited by law; and (3) not be an item that falls within the scope of some other appropriation or statutory funding scheme.  <br /><br />See <a href="#not-implemented">Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 4-19 to 4- 29, 4-162 to 4-164</a> (discussing Comptroller General�s view of the �necessary expense� doctrine and government-sponsored contests).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> have increased latitude to offer cash prizes in competitions that involve artistic design.  See <a href="#not-implemented">Government Accountability Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, 4-162 to 4-164.</a> Any prize purse awarded must be related to the reasonable cost of producing the design. See id.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Authority to Provide Non-Monetary Support to Prize Competitions</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> have statutory authorities in areas such as public education, outreach, and the like that can serve as a basis for supporting prize competitions without providing funds.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> be able to conduct a procurement in a contest-like manner to encourage greater innovation and private sector participation, when the payment of a prize is for a good or service for the benefit of the government.   Where appropriate, an agency could thus use existing procurement authority, such as that provided by the <a href="#not-implemented">Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Chapter 1)</a>, to issue a solicitation seeking offers that would have to meet certain technical criteria � essentially the rules of the contest � for which the agency would pay a fixed amount (the prize).  In situations where small monetary prizes or small procurements are considered (in particular, below the $100,000 simplified acquisition procedure threshold), agencies might also be able to leverage the flexibilities afforded by simplified acquisition procedures to allow for innovative, contest-based approaches to such procurements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In addition, a contractor <strong>may</strong> be able to conduct a prize competition among sub- contractors to encourage innovative means of satisfying the contract and achieving the agency�s procurement needs.  Agencies <strong>should</strong> work with their Office of General Counsel and procurement officials to structure competitions that are compliant with applicable rules and regulations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Other Transactions Authority</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some agencies are authorized to enter into �other transactions� (OTs), which may provide those agencies with the flexibility to structure prize competitions that draw in entities that do not traditionally do business with the Federal Government or to leverage private sector funding.  These authorities differ by agency, so those agencies that possess OT authority <strong>should</strong> consult their general counsels and examine their specific implementing regulations and guidance documents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies with OT authority <strong>should</strong> work with their Offices of General Counsel to determine whether this authority would be beneficial in structuring competitions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Partnership Authority</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies may have statutory authority to form partnerships with other agencies. See, e.g., <a href="#not-implemented">49 U.S.C. � 106(l)(6), 106(m)</a> (providing FAA with the authority to enter into �other transactions� with and to accept �services, equipment, personnel, and facilities� from other Federal agencies).  Such authority may prove useful to agencies that want to further their statutory missions by working with or supporting other agencies� prize endeavors. If contemplating such a partnership, an agency <strong>should</strong> be sure to consult with its Office of General Counsel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Public-Private Partnership Authority</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies may have authority to partner with outside entities such as foundations and nonprofit organizations that may elect to award cash prizes or other forms of recognition directly to the winners of government prize competitions.  A supplemental award from the private sector can increase the incentives for participation in a competition. An agency considering such partnerships <strong>should</strong> consult with its Office of General Counsel, and <strong>should</strong> specifically consider issues relating to its solicitation or gift acceptance authorities to ensure compliance with the rule against augmenting appropriations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Other Prize-Related Legal Issues</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>FACA Compliance</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> be sure to comply with <a href="#not-implemented">FACA</a>�s requirements, where applicable, when establishing a method of selecting a prize or contest winner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Ethical Issues and Federal Endorsement of Products or Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Federal employees <strong>must</strong> comply with the <a href="#not-implemented">Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. Part 2635</a>, and the general principle that employees will act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.   Any competition, challenge, or contest run by or with the involvement of a Federal agency <strong>must</strong> be run so as to ensure participants are treated equally and there is no conflict of interest, or appearance of a conflict, on the part of the contest judges or administrators.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Moreover, agencies <strong>should</strong> avoid any improper Federal endorsement of products or services when creating contests and prizes.  See 5 <a href="#not-implemented">C.F.R. 2635.702(c)</a>.  Federal endorsement is not improper when it is �[i]n furtherance of statutory authority to promote products, services or enterprises� or �[a]s a result of documentation of compliance with agency requirements or standards or as the result of recognition for achievement given under an agency program of recognition for accomplishment in support of the agency�s mission.�  Id. Thus, agencies contemplating contests or prizes that could lead to the appearance of Federal endorsement <strong>should</strong> examine their statutory authorities to determine if they have authority to promote products, services, or enterprises, or whether the contest or prize is offered �in support of� their statutory mission.  Agencies <strong>should</strong> consult with their Offices of General Counsel on avoiding conflicts of interest and engaging in or permitting Federal endorsement, or the appearance thereof, in connection with government contests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Intellectual Property</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> carefully consider whether a competition will involve intellectual property and determine in advance how to assign the rights to such works between themselves and the winning contestants.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> consult with their general counsels in determining how to assign intellectual property rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Compliance with State Law</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> evaluate the need for potential contests and prizes to comply with varying state laws.  To the extent that state laws apply to a Federal prize competition at all, be aware that states generally regulate contests of chance much more heavily than they do contests of skill, and that injecting any element of chance into the selection of a contest or prize winner may significantly alter the state legal requirements with which the agency must comply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Standard Requirements for Procurement Contracts, Grants, and Cooperative Agreements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies that enter into procurement contracts, issue grants, or enter into cooperative agreements regarding prize competitions <strong>should</strong> consider standard requirements for documentation, reporting, and audits, and the <a href="#not-implemented">Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. � 200 et seq.)</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Depending on the objectives, types, and sizes of prize competitions to be awarded, agencies <strong>may</strong> be able to modify the standard requirements to better match the administration and purposes of these awards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> consider applying all standard requirements pertaining to pre-award and audit requirements, and modifying � to the extent allowable by law � the requirements for post-award requirements and compliance with the OMB cost principles.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> modify the post-award and cost compliance requirements with respect to program income and financial reporting.  This could include, for purposes of illustration and when legally allowable, a waiver of the requirement for recipients to file a final financial report since the awards are for fixed amounts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>may</strong> also opt not to apply OMB cost principles since the prize awards are pre-determined and not based on costs.  Exceptions to standard requirements should be made on a case by case basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Paperwork Reduction Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> evaluate the applicability of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to any prize-related activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As a general matter, if an agency is directing identical questions to, or imposing identical recordkeeping requirements on, ten or more persons, then such an information collection is subject to the <a href="#not-implemented">PRA (44 U.S.C. � 3501 et seq.</a>; <a href="#not-implemented">5 C.F.R. Part 1320).</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An agency is, however, permitted to <strong>ask</strong> the general public about ideas for improving current practices, and these general requests do not become subject to the PRA merely because they take the form of a contest, or because the agency announces that it will give a prize to those with the best ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>General Requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Subject to the requirements set forth below, agencies <strong>may</strong> use third-party websites and applications to engage openly with the public. These websites and applications offer new tools that will help people to connect with their government, promoting the goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> also provide individuals with alternatives to third-party websites and applications. People <strong>should</strong> be able to obtain comparable information and services through an agency�s official website or other official means. For example, members of the public <strong>should</strong> be able to learn about the agency�s activities and to communicate with the agency without having to join a third-party social media website. In addition, if an agency uses a third-party service to solicit feedback, the agency <strong>should</strong> provide an alternative government email address where users can also send feedback.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Third-Party Privacy Policies.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Before an agency uses any third-party website or application to engage with the public, the agency <strong>should</strong> examine the third party�s privacy policy to evaluate the risks and determine whether the website or application is appropriate for the agency�s use. In addition, the agency <strong>should</strong> monitor any changes to the third party�s privacy policy and periodically reassess the risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>External Links</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If an agency posts a link that leads to a third-party website or any other location that is not part of an official government domain, the agency <strong>should</strong> provide an alert to the visitor, such as a statement adjacent to the link or a �pop-up,� explaining that visitors are being directed to a nongovernment website that may have different privacy policies from those of the agency�s official website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Embedded Applications</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Branding</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In general, when an agency uses a third-party website or application that is not part of an official government domain, the agency <strong>should</strong> apply appropriate branding to distinguish the agency�s activities from those of nongovernment actors. For example, to the extent practicable, an agency <strong>should</strong> add its seal or emblem to its profile page on a social media website to indicate that it is an official agency presence.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Information Collection.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If information is collected through an agency�s use of a third-party website or application, the agency should collect only the information �necessary for the proper performance of agency functions and which has practical utility.� If personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, the agency should collect only the minimum necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation, or executive order</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>Immediate Review of Financial Systems IT Projects</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Guiding Principles</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Split projects into smaller, simpler segments with clear deliverables</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Project segments <strong>should</strong> generally take no longer than 90 -120 days to achieve specific project milestones. Although all specific milestones may not deliver functionality, all such milestones must support the delivery of well defined functionality. The overall length of a development project <strong>should</strong> not exceed 24 months. Historically, Federal government IT projects have involved expansive, long-term projects that attempt to change almost every aspect of a business system at once. These projects have taken years, sometimes a decade, and have failed at alarming rates. The best practice in IT project design now focuses on the development of an overall, high-level system architecture with specific development projects working on tight timetables with clear deliverables that provide interim functionality. This approach simplifies planning, development, project management and oversight, and training. It reduces risk and allows changes in technology to be incorporated into later phases at lower costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Focus on most critical business needs first.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Historic practice in Federal IT system projects has been to attempt to address a wide range of needs at once through expansive process reengineering projects. The complexity involved in this approach has added substantially to costs, significantly increased risks and delayed implementation of all functionality, including the most critical needs. One of the benefits of the segmented approach outlined above is that it allows prioritization of needs and functionality. The most critical functionality can be delivered first while functions of lesser importance can be considered for subsequent delivery. Among other benefits, this process has been proven to cause a healthy reevaluation or reconsideration of secondary functions after critical functions are in place and being used. Therefore, revised projects plans <strong>should</strong> prioritize the most critical financial functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Ongoing, transparent project oversight</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the major causes of IT system failure is insufficient oversight by senior management. Often in the Federal government, senior agency managers do not adequately monitor projects on an ongoing basis once they are underway. Proven best practices in this area include identifying up-front a series of milestones, warning flags, and stop points over the course of the segment lifecycle which, if deemed necessary, can cause the project to be suspended and returned to planning. Additionally, clear deliverables <strong>should</strong> be monitored closely and any delays in deliverables <strong>should</strong> automatically result in a more in-depth review of a project. Finally, mechanisms for review of project status by senior management <strong>should</strong> be built into a project plan. Revised agency projects plans <strong>should</strong> integrate these best practices into their oversight processes.</p>

<p class='context'>OMB Review Process</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Projects Subject to Review</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Projects Subject to Review , all financial system modernization projects with $20 million or more in planned spending on development or modernization expenses shall be halted pending an agency re-evaluation and a subsequent review by OMB as noted below. In addition, as a part of this review, projects identified as high-risk by OMB <strong>should</strong> require more frequent assessment to include review of task orders or activities. Review of projects nearing completion may be abbreviated and will include consideration of the costs and benefits of implementing the policy within the project. Agencies that have previously completed modernization projects must refrain from moving into additional rounds of planning and development until OMB has approved a revised implementation plan for those projects consistent with this guidance. Lastly, OMB may review systems that have completed implementation when a failure occurs (e.g., the system fails in performing basic functions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Financial Systems Advisory Board</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As of this date, OMB is establishing the Financial Systems Advisory Board (Board) under the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Council. The Board <strong>will</strong> include CFOs and CIOs from major agencies and have available experts from various communities, including acquisition and e-government. Its function <strong>will</strong> be to make recommendations to OMB, as requested, on projects being reviewed under this memorandum. Agencies with longstanding expertise in IT project management may also be asked to participate more extensively and directly with OMB in the overall review process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Agency Project Plans</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within 60 days of this order, agencies <strong>will</strong> provide revised project plans for all projects covered herein to OMB for review. Such plans, as described in Attachment A, shall clearly outline the project�s strategy for reducing costs, shortening the project timeline, and reducing risks. Criteria for review <strong>will</strong> be the Guiding Principles described earlier in this Memorandum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Project Review</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB <strong>will</strong> review revised project plans within 60 days of submission. This review may include presentation of plans to the Board for its evaluation and recommendations, but OMB <strong>will</strong> make the final decision regarding approval of a revised project plan. Many agencies have already begun working on revised project plans. Attachment B includes an initial schedule of review dates for these projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Funds Execution and Link to Project Reviews</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning in the first quarter of FY 2011, to align with this guidance, financial system investments subject to this guidance <strong>will</strong> be apportioned consistent with a segmented approach. Where the apportionment process is employed, funding shall be controlled under Category B on a quarterly basis. As such, contracts shall reflect the overall implementation phase of 18 to 24 months, with task orders written to reflect 90 to 120-day deliverables. Task orders shall be funded consistent with the apportionment � after OMB review throughout the development, modernization, and execution phases. For projects that OMB has not designated as high-risk or that have a proven track record of achieving specific milestones within well-defined segments, OMB may employ flexibility regarding funds control. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB shall assess whether or not an investment should receive funding for the next segment. If approved, OMB <strong>will</strong> apportion funding for the next segment under Category B. If approval is not granted, OMB <strong>will</strong> work with the affected agency to redirect funding pursuant to existing Congressional reprogramming requirements. An agency�s failure to complete a segment as planned may be a basis for canceling the remaining investment. Additionally, inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate data or documentation may be justification for redirecting funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Future Reviews</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Subsequent to initial project reviews and approval of revised plans, OMB <strong>will</strong> review project status, and as necessary <strong>will</strong> re-engage the Board, on a quarterly basis through FY 2012. These reviews <strong>will</strong> be used, among other things, to inform the appropriations process for FY 2011 and OMB�s review of budget proposals for FY 2012. Funding for projects subject to the apportionment process under this guidance <strong>will</strong> continue to be apportioned on a quarterly basis through Category B allocations. Projects must continue to meet 90 to 120-day milestones in order for OMB to release project funding for additional segments. For projects that have a proven track record of achieving specific milestones within well-defined segments, OMB may employ flexibility regarding funds control.</p>

<p class='context'>Shared Services, Financial System Standards, and Financial Software Testing and Certification</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Shared Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB supports shared service arrangements when cost effective, but <strong>will</strong> no longer mandate them in all cases for financial management systems. Past attempts to mandate use of financial management shared services yielded inconsistent results, as medium and large agencies encountered the same types of costs and risks with a shared service provider as they did when modernizing �in house.� These risks, along with early reluctance by Federal agencies to fully leverage the shared service model, led agencies to pursue shared service arrangements for low impact areas in terms of operational efficiency, such as common hosting, and to defer higher impact areas, such as common transaction processing. OMB expects the requirements to re-scope agency modernization projects contained in this guidance <strong>will</strong> enable greater adoption of shared service arrangements with lower risk and greater cost impacts. Further, financial management shared service efforts <strong>will</strong> now focus on the higher impact area of transaction processing. OMB, Department of the Treasury, and the CFO Council <strong>will</strong> identify the development of common automated solutions for transaction processing. The Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation, which has been recently established within Treasury�s Fiscal Service, <strong>will</strong> pilot these solutions. The first priorities <strong>will</strong> be to develop initial operating capabilities for vendor invoicing and intergovernmental transactions. Existing shared service relationships <strong>will</strong> remain unchanged, but agencies that are being cross-serviced can re-evaluate whether the current and future relationship remains cost-effective.</p>

<p class='context'>Financial System Standards.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Current �Core Financial System� requirements remain in effect and Federal agencies have an ongoing responsibility to comply with them. OMB <strong>will</strong> soon issue a revision to OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, which <strong>will</strong> update existing requirements and include new guidance on how agencies and auditors <strong>will</strong> assess compliance with these requirements. Specifically, OMB <strong>will</strong> initiate a performance based approach to assessing compliance that <strong>will</strong> assist in the overall objective to reduce the cost, risk, and complexity of financial system modernizations. The objective of this approach <strong>will</strong> be to provide additional flexibility for Federal agencies to initiate smaller scale financial modernizations as long as relevant financial management outcomes (e.g., clean audits, proper controls, timely reporting) are maintained.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Software Certification</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>OMB is reforming the certification process by shifting the accountability for software performance to the vendor through self-certification. To the extent software functionality does not perform in accordance with vendor certification, the Federal agency <strong>will</strong> hold the vendor accountable in the same manner in which other contractual obligations are enforced, such as through the imposing of liquidated damages, requiring repair or replacement, or terminating the contract. If the contractor is found to have made any materially false or fraudulent statements or representations, it may be subject to penalties under the False Statement Act. This should make contractors clearly accountable for delivering what they promise. OMB <strong>will</strong>, as appropriate, revisit this policy on an annual basis to determine the potential need for refinement. Additional details related to this change to the testing process <strong>will</strong> be provided in an upcoming revision to OMB CircularA-127, scheduled to be issued this summer, as well as the OMB Audit Bulletin.</p>

<p class='context'>Clarifying Cybersecurity Responsibilities and Activities of EOP and DHS</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Under various national security and homeland security Presidential directives, and pursuant to its statutory authorities, DHS oversees critical infrastructure protection, operates the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), oversees implementation of the Trusted Internet Connection initiative, and takes other actions to help secure both the Federal civilian government systems and the private sector. At the same time, OMB has a number of<br />cybersecurity responsibilities, principally in connection with FISMA. The Cybersecurity Coordinator leads the interagency process for cybersecurity strategy and policy development. To clarify and avoid confusion, effective immediately, OMB will be responsible for the submission of the annual FISMA report to Congress, for the development and approval of the cybersecurity portions of the President�s Budget, for the traditional OMB budgetary and fiscal oversight of the agencies� use of funds, and for coordination with the Cybersecurity Coordinator on all policy issues related to the prior three responsibilities. The Cybersecurity Coordinator will have visibility into DHS efforts to ensure Federal agency compliance with FISMA and will serve as the principal White House official to coordinate interagency cooperation with DHS cybersecurity efforts. Effective immediately, DHS will exercise primary responsibility within the executive branch for the operational aspects of Federal agency cybersecurity with respect to the Federal information systems that fall within FISMA under 44 U.S.C. �3543. In carrying out this responsibility and the accompanying activities, DHS <strong>shall</strong> be subject to general OMB oversight in accordance with July 6, 2010 Section 3543(a), and DHS <strong>shall</strong> be subject to the limitations and requirements that apply to OMB under Section 3543(b)-(c). DHS activities will include (but will not be limited to): <br />� overseeing the government-wide and agency-specific implementation of and reporting on cybersecurity policies and guidance; <br />� overseeing and assisting government-wide and agency-specific efforts to provide adequate, risk-based and cost-effective cybersecurity; <br />� overseeing the agencies� compliance with FISMA and developing analyses for OMB to assist in the development of the FISMA annual report; <br />� overseeing the agencies� cybersecurity operations and incident response and providing appropriate assistance; and <br />� annually reviewing the agencies� cybersecurity programs. <br /><br />All departments and agencies <strong>shall</strong> coordinate and cooperate with DHS as it carries out its cybersecurity responsibility and activities as noted here.</p>

<p class='context'>Immediate Review of Information Technology Projects</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the FY 2012 Budget formulation process, CIO Council agencies will be required to develop and put in place improvement plans for their highest-risk IT projects. Pursuant to that objective, agencies <strong>shall</strong> take the following steps: <br />1. Identify agency high-risk IT projects, <br />2. Develop improvement plans for these projects, and <br />3. Present improvement plans in TechStat sessions. The steps of this process are detailed below. <br /><br />1. Identify Agency High-Risk IT Projects <br />The Federal CIO will select, collaboratively with agency CIOs, the high-risk IT projects across the Federal Government. Using the IT Dashboard and other sources of information, agency CIOs <strong>shall</strong> describe the risk profile of the largest, most complex IT projects. Risk factors would include: - Significant cost or schedule variance from the current baseline<br />- Performance targets or mission objectives have not been met, <br />- Frequent re-baselines, or <br />- Lack of essential executive sponsorship/leadership.<br /><br />The Federal CIO will schedule individual sessions with agency CIOs (as outlined in attachment A), between August 2 and August 18, to identify the highest risk projects across the Federal IT portfolio. The list of high-risk projects will be finalized by August 23. It is anticipated that 25 to 30 projects will be selected across the Federal government.<br /><br />2. Develop Improvement Plans<br />Agencies <strong>shall</strong> submit a proposed improvement plan for each high-risk project. Agencies<br /><strong>shall</strong> submit proposed improvement plans to OMB no later than 30 days after their high-risk<br />projects are identified. While formal improvement plans are only required for these projects, agency CIOs are accountable for the performance of the entire IT portfolio, not limited to just the high-risk projects. Therefore, similar improvement plans should be applied to other high-risk projects in an agency�s entire IT portfolio. Agency proposed improvement plans should be based on thorough analysis of the projects� issues and risks. Plans should be comprehensive, risk-adjusted, and reviewed through appropriate agency governance bodies. The plan may incorporate short and long term solutions that may extend through Budget Year 2012. If the agency CIO does not have high confidence in the probability of success of the investment, the agency CIO should recommend that the project be materially altered or terminated.<br /> <br />The proposed improvement plan should include:<br />a. Major challenges and causes of variance from the project baseline,<br />b. A summary of risks, mitigation strategies, and clear accountability,<br />c. Stronger contractor performance metrics and controls for existing contracts, and revised<br />acquisition strategies for contracts expected to be executed within the next fiscal year that<br />address the issues raised in the improvement plan,<br />d. A high-level schedule that articulates critical path items,<br />e. Agencies should describe how the project�s governance will be more rigorous because of<br />the improvement plan. Agencies should also describe how they will improve both<br />contract and program management oversight internally to ensure better performance, and<br />f. List the specific corrective actions to turn around the project.<br /><br />3. Present Improvement Plans in TechStat Sessions<br />The proposed improvement plans for the selected high-risk projects will be reviewed in<br />OMB TechStat Accountability Sessions led by the Federal CIO. These sessions will be conducted between September and November. At the TechStat session, the agency will brief OMB on the improvement plans, revised schedules, and potential changes to budget requests.<br /><br />The TechStat sessions will be used to inform OMB decisions on FY 2012 budget requests<br />and potential FY 2011 apportionments. TechStat sessions will also provide feedback and<br />recommendations to agencies concerning project scope, management and oversight.</p>

<p class='context'>Improving Acquisition through Strategic Sourcing</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This memorandum builds on the Administration's successful efforts and establishes a broad strategic sourcing initiative to ensure that all agencies <strong>manage</strong> their acquisitions effectively and that, wherever possible, agencies join together to negotiate the best deal for the taxpayer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>While every agency <strong>must</strong> eliminate inefficiencies from its acquisition processes, this initiative puts additional responsibilities for designing and implementing government-wide strategic sourcing solutions on large agencies, which make up the vast majority of all Federal contracting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>I. Designation of Strategic Sourcing Accountable Officials (SSAOs) by CFO Act Agencies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the head of each of the 24 Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies <strong>shall</strong> designate a Strategic Sourcing Accountable Official (SSAO), who will have the authority to coordinate the agency's internal strategic sourcing activities and its participation in government wide efforts, such as those described below. Each agency <strong>shall</strong> send the proposed SSAO's name and contact information to OMB by January 15, 2013.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Il. Establishment of the Interagency Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council (SSLC)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council (SSLC) <strong>shall</strong>, in consultation with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the Chief Financial Officers Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Performance Improvement Council, and other interagency councils as necessary, lead the government's efforts to increase the use of government-wide management and sourcing of goods and services.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The SSLC <strong>will</strong> meet regularly to provide long-term leadership of the government's strategic sourcing efforts as well as to take actions that save taxpayer dollars now.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To that end, by March 2013, the SSLC <strong>shall</strong> submit to OMB a set of recommendations for management strategies for specific goods and services � including several IT commodities identified through the PortfolioStat process - that would ensure that the Federal government receives the most favorable offer possible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    identify at least five products and/or services for which new government-wide acquisition vehicles or management approaches should be developed and made mandatory, to the maximum extent practicable, for the SSLC agencies;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�   for these identified commodities and solutions, provide a supporting spend analysis, estimate savings opportunities, and define metrics for tracking progress;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    identify existing contract vehicles and relevant contract renewal dates that could be used to develop transition strategies to the new solutions;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�     identify agencies that should serve as "executive agents" to lead the development of each of these new solutions (with the assistance of interagency teams comprised of agency experts);</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�       propose plans and management strategies to maximize the use of each strategic sourcing effort;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�        propose vendor management or other strategies that could be used to reduce the variability in the prices paid for similar goods and services, where the development of new government-wide vehicles may not be immediately feasible; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>SSLC recommendations <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�          propose other savings strategies that could be implemented, such as adapting existing vehicles (e.g., Multiple Award Schedules, GWACs, and Multi-agency Contracts) to ensure that certain characteristics of strategic sourcing are followed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each of the SSLC agencies <strong>shall</strong> promote, to the maximum extent practicable, sound strategic sourcing practices within their agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each SSLC agency <strong>shall</strong> establish an internal cross-functional strategic sourcing council to oversee the agency's related activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Reqs. 74.01-74.15] These efforts include, but are not limited to, issuing and <strong>enforcing</strong> mandatory use policies for government wide and agency wide strategic sourcing solutions to the extent appropriate, providing acquisition and management data to the General Services Administration and other executive agents in support of the development of new solutions, and tracking spending and savings information for use by OMB, as further directed by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <strong>shall</strong>:<br />�� increase the transparency of prices paid for common goods and services for use by agency officials in market research and negotiations; and</p>

<li>
<p>The Administrator of General Services <strong>shall</strong>:<br />�� as needed, promulgate requirements, regulations, and best practices for acquiring, using, and, where applicable, disposing of the commodities managed through strategic sourcing initiatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>IV. Characteristics of Strategic Sourcing Acquisition Vehicles</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />� reflect input from a large number of potential agency users � especially the largest likely users � regarding customer demand for the goods and services being considered, the acquisition strategy (including contract pricing, delivery and other terms and conditions, and performance requirements), and the commodity management approach;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�  ensure that the Federal government gets credit for all sales provided under that vehicle, regardless of payment method, unless the sales are identified with other government contracts, so that volume-based pricing discounts can be applied;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    include tiered pricing, or other appropriate strategies, to reduce prices as cumulative sales volume increases;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�    require vendors to provide sufficient pricing, usage, and performance data to enable the government to improve their commodity management practices on an ongoing basis; and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>However, at a minimum, government-wide vehicles <strong>shall</strong>:  <br />�      be supported by a contract administration plan that demonstrates commitment by the executive agent to perform active commodity management and monitor vendor performance and pricing changes throughout the life of the contract to ensure the benefits of strategic sourcing are maintained.</p>

<p class='context'>V. Increasing Small Business Opportunities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To the maximum extent practicable, all strategic sourcing opportunities <strong>shall</strong> seek to increase participation by small businesses.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Definitions [for use in Policy 75]<br />Data: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term "data" refers to all structured information, unless otherwise noted. <br />Dataset: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the  "dataset" refers to a collection of data presented in tabular or non-tabular form. <br />Fair Information Practice Principles: The term "Fair Information Practice Principles" refers to the eight widely accepted principles for identifying and mitigating privacy impacts in information systems, programs and processes, delineated in the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. <br />Government information: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, "government information" means information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of, by or for the Federal Government. <br />Information: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, the term " information" means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. <br />Information life cycle: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, the term " information life cycle" means the stages through which information passes, typically characterized as creation or collection, processing, dissemination, use, storage, and disposition. <br />Personally identifiable information: As defined in OMB Memorandum M-1 0-23 , 17 "personally identifiable information" (PIT) refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual ' s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-PIT can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available (in any medium and from any source) that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual. <br />Mosaic effect: The mosaic effect occurs when the information in an individual dataset, in isolation, may not pose a risk of identifying an individual (or threatening some other important interest such as security), but when combined with other available information, could pose such risk. Before disclosing potential PIT or other potentially sensitive information, agencies must consider other publicly available data - in any medium and from any source- to determine whether some combination of existing data and the data<br />intended to be' publicly released could allow for the identification of an individual or pose another security<br />concern.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Open data: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term "open data" refers to publicly available data structured in a way that enables the data to be fully discoverable and usable by end users. In general, open data will be consistent with the following principles: <br />� Public. Consistent with OMB's Open Government Directive, agencies must adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted  by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions. <br />� Accessible. Open data are made available in convenient, modifiable, and open formats  that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing). Open data structures do not discriminate against any person or group of persons and should be made available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To the extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly available, and no restrictions should be placed upon their use. <br />� Described. Open data are described fully so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to understand their strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how to process them. This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that describe data), thorough documentation of data elements, data dictionaries, and, if applicable, additional descriptions of the purpose of the collection, the population of interest, the characteristics of the sample, and the method of data collection.<br />� Reusable. Open data are made available under an open license that places no restrictions on their use. <br />� Complete. Open data are published in primary forms (i.e., as collected at the source), with the finest possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements. Derived or aggregate open data should also be published but must reference the primary data . <br />� Timely. Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs. <br />� Managed Post-Release. A point of contact must be designated to assist with data use and to respond to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.</p>

<p class='context'>Scope</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>"Project Open Data," a new OMB and OSTP resource, is an online repository of tools, best practices, and schema to help agencies adopt the framework presented in this guidance. Project Open Data can be accessed at http://project-open-data.github.io. Project Open Data will evolve over time as a community resource to facilitate adoption of open data practices. The repository includes definitions, code, checklists, case studies, and more, and enables collaboration across the Federal Government, in partnership with public developers, as applicable. Agencies can visit Project Open Data for a more comprehensive glossary of terms related to open data.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Policy Requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collect</strong> or create information in a way that supports downstream information processing and dissemination activities - Consistent with OMB <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-130</a>, agencies must consider, at each stage of the information life cycle, the effects of decisions and actions on other stages of the life cycle. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, agencies must design new information collection and creation eff011s so that the information collected or created supports downstream interoperability between information systems and dissemination of information to the public, as appropriate, without the need for costly retrofitting. This includes consideration and consultation of key target audiences for the information when determining format, frequency of update, and other information management decisions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use machine-readable and open formats 19 - Agencies <strong>must</strong> use machine-readable and open formats for information as it is collected or created. While information should be collected electronically by default, machine-readable and open formats <strong>must</strong> be used in conjunction with both electronic and telephone or paper-based information collection effot1s. Additionally, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data and to the extent permitted by law, agencies should prioritize the use of open formats that are nonproprietary, publicly available, and that place no restrictions upon their use.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use data standards- Consistent with existing policies relating to Federal agencies' use of standards2 for information as it is collected or created, agencies <strong>must</strong> use standards in order to promote data interoperability and openness.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ensure information stewardship through the use of open licenses - Agencies <strong>must</strong> apply open licenses, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data, to information as it is collected or created so that if data are made public there are no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, adapting, or otherwise using the information for non-commercial or for commercial purposes  1 When information is acquired or accessed by an agency through performance of a contract, appropriate existing clauses shall be utilized to meet these objectives while recognizing that contractors may have proprietary interests in such information, and that protection of such information may be necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to government programs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use common core and extensible metadata- Agencies <strong>must</strong> describe information using<br />common core metadata, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data, as it is collected and created. Metadata should also include information about origin, linked data, geographic location, time series continuations, data quality, and other relevant indices that reveal relationships between datasets and allow the public to determine the fitness of the data source. Agencies may expand upon the basic common metadata based on standards, specifications, or formats developed within different communities (e.g., financial, health, geospatial, law enforcement). Groups that develop and promulgate these metadata<br />specifications <strong>must</strong> review them for compliance with the common core metadata standard, specifications, and formats.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Build information systems to support interoperability and information accessibility- Through their acquisition and technology management processes, agencies <strong>must</strong> build or modernize information systems in a way that maximizes interoperability and information accessibility, to the extent practicable and permitted by law. To this end, agencies should leverage existing Federal IT guidance, such as the Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture, when designing information systems. Agencies <strong>must</strong> exercise forethought when architecting, building, or substantially modifying an information system to facilitate public distribution, where appropriate. In addition, the agency's CIO <strong>must</strong> validate that the following minimum requirements have been incorporated into acquisition planning documents and technical design for all new information systems and those preparing for modernization, as appropriate: a. The system design <strong>must</strong> be scalable, flexible, and facilitate extraction of data in multiple formats and for a range of uses as internal and external needs change, including potential uses not accounted for in the original design. In general, this will involve the use of standards and specifications in the system design that promote industry best practices for information sharing, and separation of data from the application layer to maximize data reuse opportunities and incorporation of future application or technology capabilities, in consultation with the best practices found in Project Open Data; b. All data outputs associated with the system <strong>must</strong> meet the requirements described in part III, sections l. a-e of this Memorandum and be accounted for in the data inventory described in part III section 3 .a; and c. Data schema and dictionaries have been documented and shared with internal pmtners and the public, as applicable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Strengthen data management and release practices- To ensure that agency data assets are managed and maintained throughout their life cycle, agencies <strong>must</strong> adopt effective data asset p01tfolio management approaches. Within six (6) months of the date of this Memorandum, agencies and interagency groups <strong>must</strong> review and, where appropriate, revise existing policies and procedures to strengthen their data management and release practices to ensure consistency with the requirements in this Memorandum, and take the following actions:</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create and maintain an enterprise data inventory- Agencies <strong>must</strong> update their inventory of agency information resources (as required by OMB <a href="#not-implemented">Circular A-130</a>)24 to include an enterprise data inventory, if it does not already exist, that accounts for datasets used in the agency' s information systems. The inventory will be built out over time, with the ultimate goal of including all agency datasets, to the extent practicable. The inventory will indicate, as appropriate, if the agency has determined that the individual datasets may be made publicly available (i.e., release is permitted by law, subject to all privacy, confidentiality, security, and other valid requirements) and whether they are currently available to the public. The Senior Agency Official for Records Management should be consulted on integration with the records management process. Agencies should use the Data Reference Model from the Federal Enterprise Architecture to help create and maintain their inventory. Agencies <strong>must</strong> describe datasets within the inventory using the common core and extensible metadata (see part III, section l.e).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create and maintain a public data listing- Any datasets in the agency's enterprise data inventory that can be made publicly available must be listed at www.[agency].gov/data in a human- and machine-readable format that enables automatic aggregation by Data.gov and other services (known as " harvestable files"), to the extent practicable. This should include datasets that can be made publicly available but have not yet been released. This public data listing should also include, to the extent permitted by law and existing terms and conditions, datasets that were produced through agency-funded grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements (excluding any data submitted primarily for the purpose of contract monitoring and administration), and, where feasible, be accompanied by standard citation information, preferably in the form of a persistent identifier. The public data listing will be built out over time, with the ultimate goal of including all agency datasets that can be made publicly available. See Project Open Data for best practices, tools, and schema to implement the public data listing and harvestable files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create a process to engage with customers to help facilitate and prioritize data release Agencies <strong>must</strong> create a process to engage with customers, through their www.[agency] .gov/data pages and other necessary means, to solicit help in prioritizing the release of datasets and determining the most usable and appropriate formats for release?6 Agencies should make data available in multiple formats according to their customer needs. For example, high-volume datasets of interest to developers should be released using bulk downloads as well as Application Programming Interfaces (Apies). In addition, customer engagement eff01ts should help agencies prioritize efforts to improve the discoverability and usability of datasets that have already been released to the public but are not yet fully "open" (e.g., they are only available in closed, inaccessible formats). See Project Open Data for best practices and tools that can be used to implement customer engagement efforts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Clarify roles and responsibilities for promoting efficient and effective data release practices- Agencies <strong>must</strong> ensure that roles and responsibilities are clearly designated for the promotion of efficient and effective data release practices across the agency, and that proper authorities have been granted to execute on related responsibilities, including: 1. Communicating the strategic value of open data to internal stakeholders and the public; 11. Ensuring that data released to the public are open (as defined in part I), as appropriate, and a point of contact is designated to assist open data use and to respond to complaints about adherence to open data requirements; 111. Engaging entrepreneurs and innovators in the private and nonprofit sectors to encourage and facilitate the use of agency data to build applications and services; IV. Working with agency components to scale best practices from bureaus and offices that excel in open data practices across the enterprise; v. Working with the agency's Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) or other relevant officials to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully protected; and v1. Working with the Chief information Security Officer (CISO) and mission owners to assess overall organizational risk, based on the impact of releasing potentially sensitive data, and make a risk-based determination.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Strengthen measures to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully protected and that data are properly secured- Agencies <strong>must</strong> incorporate privacy analyses into each stage of the information 's life cycle. In particular, agencies <strong>must</strong> review the information collected or created for valid restrictions to release to determine whether it can be made publicly available, consistent with the Open Government Directive's presumption in favor of openness, and to the extent permitted by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality pledge, security, trade secret, contractual, or other valid restrictions to release. If the agency determines that information should not be made publicly available on one of these grounds, the agency <strong>must</strong> document this determination in consultation with its Office of General Counsel or equivalent. As agencies consider whether or not information may be disclosed, they <strong>must</strong> also account for the "mosaic effect" of data aggregation. Agencies should note that the mosaic effect demands a risk-based analysis, often utilizing statistical methods whose parameters can change over time, depending on the nature of the information, the availability of other information, and the technology in place that could facilitate the process of identification. Because of the cop1plexity of this analysis and the scope of data involved, agencies may choose to take advantage of entities in the Executive Branch that may have relevant expe1tise, including the staff of Data.gov. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each agency to perform the necessary analysis and comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies. In some cases, this assessment may affect the amount, type, form, and detail of data released by agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As OMB has noted, "The individual's right to privacy must be protected in Federal Government information activities involving personal information." As agencies consider security-related restrictions to release, they <strong>should</strong> focus on information confidentiality, integrity, and availability as part of the agency's overall risk management framework. They are required to incorporate the <a href="#not-implemented">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199</a> "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems," which includes guidance and definitions for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Agencies <strong>should</strong> also consult with the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) program to ensure compliance with CUI requirements, the National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding/0 and the best practices found in Project Open Data. In addition to complying with the Privacy Act of 1974, the �-Government Act of2002, FISMA, and CIPSEA, agencies <strong>should</strong> implement information policies based upon Fair Information Practice Principles and NIST guidance on Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. For example, agencies must: <br />a. Collect or create only that information necessary for the proper performance of agency functions and which has practical utility; <br />b. Limit the collection or creation of information which identifies individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary for the proper performance of agency functions; <br />c. Limit the sharing of information that identifies individuals or contains proprietary information to that which is legally authorized, and impose appropriate conditions on use where a continuing obligation to ensure the confidentiality of the information exists; <br />d. Ensure that information is protected commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information;<br />e. Take into account other publicly available information when determining whether particular information <strong>should</strong> be considered PII (as defined in part I of this Memorandum).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Incorporate new interoperability and openness requirements into core agency processes Consistent with 44 U.S.C. 3506 (b)(2), agencies <strong>must</strong> develop and maintain an Information Resource Management (IRM) Strategic Plan. IRM Strategic Plans should align with the agency' s Strategic Plan (as required by OMB Circular A-ll ), support the attainment of agency priority goals as mandated by the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010, provide a description of how IRM activities help accomplish agency missions, and ensure that IRM decisions are integrated with organizational planning, budget, procurement, financial management, human resources management, and program decisions. As part of the annual PortfolioStat process, agencies <strong>must</strong> update their IRM Strategic Plans to describe how they are meeting new and existing information life cycle management requirements. Specifically, agencies <strong>must</strong> describe how they have institutionalized and operationalized the interoperability and openness requirements in this Memorandum into their core processes across all applicable agency programs and stakeholders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Implementation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Roles and Responsibilities- The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 assigns agency CIOs statutory responsibility for promoting the effective and efficient design and operation of all major IRM processes within their agency. Accordingly, agency heads <strong>must</strong> ensure that CIOs are positioned with the responsibility and authority to implement the requirements of this Memorandum in coordination with the agency's Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Senior Agency Official for Geospatial Information, Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP), Chief lnformation Security Officer (CISO), Senior Agency Official for Records Management, and Chief Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Officer. The CIO should also work with the agency's public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners and other leadership, as applicable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A key component of agencies' management of information resources involves working closely with the agency's SAOP and other relevant officials to ensure that each stage of the planning process includes a full analysis of privacy, confidentiality, and security issues. Agency heads <strong>must</strong> also ensure that privacy and security officials are positioned with the authority to identify information that may require additional protection and agency activities that may require additional safeguards. Consistent with OMB Memorandum M-05-08, 39 each agency's SAOP <strong>must</strong> take on a central planning and policy-making role in all agency information management activities, beginning at the earliest stages of planning and continuing throughout the life cycle of the information . In addition, if an agency's SAOP is not positioned within the office of the CIO, the agency should designate an official within the office of the CIO to serve as a liaison to help coordinate with the agency's privacy office.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Government-wide Coordination- The Federal CIO will work with the United States Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and the Administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to help improve the interoperability and openness of government information. To this end, the Federal CIO will work to establish an interagency working group supp01ted by the Federal CIO Council. The working group <strong>should</strong> focus on leveraging government-wide communities of practice to help with the development of tools that support information interoperability and openness through repositories such as Project Open Data. Part of this work <strong>should</strong> be to share best practices related to interoperability and openness within government (e.g., Federal, state, local, and tribal). These collaborations shall be subject to statutory limitations and conducted in a way that fully protects privacy, confidentiality, confidential business information, and intellectual property rights.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Resources- Policy implementation may require upfront investments depending on the maturity of existing information life cycle management processes at individual agencies. Agencies are encouraged to evaluate current processes and identify implementation opportunities that may result in more efficient use of taxpayer dollars. However, effective implementation <strong>should</strong> result in downstream cost savings for the enterprise through increased interoperability and accessibility of the agency's information resources. Therefore, these potential upfront investments <strong>should</strong> be considered in the context of their future benefits and be funded appropriately through the agency' s capital planning and budget processes. Some of the requirements in this Memorandum may require additional tools and resources. Agencies <strong>should</strong> make progress commensurate with available tools and resources.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accountability Mechanisms- Progress on agency implementation of the actions required in this Memorandum <strong>will</strong> be primarily assessed by OMB and the public through analysis of the agency 's updates to IRM plans (part III, section 5), the completeness of the enterprise data inventory (part III, section 3.a), and the data made available in the agency's public data listing (part III, section 3.b).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Nothing in this Memorandum <strong>shall</strong> be construed to affect existing requirements for review and clearance of pre-decisional information by OMB relating to legislative, budgetary, administrative, and regulatory materials. Moreover, nothing in this Memorandum <strong>shall</strong> be construed to reduce the protection of information whose release would threaten national security, invade personal privacy, breach confidentiality or contractual terms, violate the <a href="#not-implemented">Trade Secrets Act</a>, violate other statute confidentiality requirements, or damage other compelling interests. This Memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<li>
<p class='context'>Definition of Major Incident</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>FISMA 2014 requires OMB to define a major incident and directs agencies to report incidents designated as �major� to Congress within seven (7) days. This reporting should follow a process that takes into account the sensitivity of breach details and the classification level of the notification.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In determining whether a Major Incident has occurred, agencies <strong>shall</strong> consider whether the incident:  <br />1) Involves information that is Classified, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)  proprietary, CUI Privacy, or CUI Other; <br />2) Is not recoverable, not recoverable within a specified amount of time, or is recoverable only with supplemental resources; and <br />3) Has a high or medium functional impact to the mission of an agency; Or <br />4) Involves the exfiltration, modification, deletion or unauthorized access or lack of availability to information or systems within certain parameters to include either:  a) A specific threshold of number of records or users affected; 10,000 or more records or 10,000 or more users affected ; or  b) Any record of special importance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Additional Guidance and Processes for Reporting Major Incidents and Breaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Although agencies <strong>may</strong> consult with the DHS United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) on whether an incident is considered a �major incident�, it is ultimately the responsibility of the victim agency to make this determination.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the initial agency notification (about a Major Incident) DHS is <strong>required</strong> to notify OMB within one (1) hour of the relevant agency notifying DHS that a major incident has occurred.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>shall</strong> also notify Congress within 7 days of the date on which the agency has a reasonable basis to conclude that a major incident has occurred; the agency should also notify affected individuals, in accordance with FISMA 2014, as �expeditiously as practicable, without unreasonable delay.�</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the initial notification to Congress of a major incident, the agency <strong>must</strong> provide to Congress additional information on the threats, actors, risks, previous risk assessments of the affected system, the current status of the affected system, and the detection, response, and remediation actions that were taken as soon as this information is available.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This Memorandum <strong>provides</strong> guidance to Federal agencies on current reporting requirements pursuant to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (<a href="#not-implemented">FFATA</a>) as well as new requirements that agencies must employ pursuant to the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (Data Act). This Memorandum includes guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury under section 4(c) of <a href="#not-implemented">FFATA</a>, as amended.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Upon issuance, this Memorandum <strong>supersedes</strong> OMB Memoranda M-09-19, Guidance on Data Submission under FFATA (June 1, 2009) and Improving Data Quality for USAspending.gov (June 12, 2013).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OMB, in coordination with Treasury, <strong>will</strong> contact Federal agencies during May 2015 with specific information regarding any necessary changes to existing implementation plans required under prior OMB guidance. Agency points of contact <strong>will</strong> be Senior Accountable Officials (SAOs), or Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) where an SAO has not been identified. Plan revisions <strong>must include</strong> designation of an SAO who is a senior official in the agency with the ability to coordinate across multiple communities and Federal Lines of Business (LOBs), in accordance with M-10-06, Open Government Directive.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In developing their implementation plans agencies <strong>should</strong> estimate resource requirements, propose an implementation timeline, and identity any foreseeable challenges, such as competing statutory, regulatory or policy priorities, to fully implement the requirements of the DATA Act as identified in this guidance. Agencies <strong>should</strong> provide suggestions to mitigate identified challenges as well as offer recommendations for how the implementation plans will manage costs and support agency investment planning.  In addition, all agencies, particularly those who are financial management Federal Shared Service Providers (FSSPs), <strong>should</strong> include specific information about anticipated costs and timelines necessary to implement this Memorandum. Agency and FSSP plans <strong>should</strong> consider existing information technology lifecycle planning, as well as requirements for collaboration with the Chief Information Officer under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). For agencies moving to FSSPs, implementation plans <strong>should</strong> align with the move to the FSSP.</p>

<p class='context'>Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of2014</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistent with the Administration's efforts to increase transparency, achieve cost savings, and create a more data-driven government, the DATA Act directs the Administration to increase the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of Federal spending information. Among other requirements, the DATA Act <strong>amends</strong> the FF ATA by requiring publication of agency-level financial data and establishing data standards for financial data two years after the date on which this guidance is issued.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Data-Centric Implementation Approach</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to significant extent of these changes [required by the DATA Act, ref. Req. 79.05, relatively short timeframe for implementation, and absense of new appropriations for agencies to carry out this work, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and other agencies <strong>will</strong> leverage existing practices that <strong>will</strong> better position the government to meet the statutory deadlines. For instance, agencies may meet the requirement for reporting agency-level financial data in the short run by using existing processes while other work is carried out to replace today's processes with data-centric reporting. Similarly, reporting award-level information <strong>will</strong> be facilitated through use of data sources (such as procurement data in the Federal Procurement Data SystemNext Generation (FPDS-NG)) that are matched with data in other locations. This approach promotes timeliness in reporting and provides an initial solution to challenges imposed by the absence of new funding streams.</p>

<p>Through the statutory deadline of May 9, 2017, agencies <strong>must</strong> follow all current transparency reporting procedures for USAspending.gov as outlined in the Award Submission Portal (ASP) User Guide for financial assistance and in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) for procurement. Agencies <strong>must</strong> ensure reported data are consistent with existing government-wide regulations, such as those listed in the FAR and 2 CFR Part 200 for Federal financial assistance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Procurement data, as provided to USAspending.gov from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS-NG or Integrated Award Environment successor), <strong>shall</strong> follow existing regulatory requirements for reporting and annual verification and validation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Financial assistance (Grants, loans, insurance, loan guarantees, cooperative agreements and other assistance) data <strong>should</strong> be submitted to the ASP [Award Submission Portal] using the Federal Assistance Awards Data System-PLUS (FAADS PLUS) format detailed at https:/ /submissions. usaspending. gov/content/ documents/U serGuide.pdf. This format is consistent with the reporting format for the Federal Assistance Award Database System (FAADS), for all financial assistance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> report financial assistance awards to individuals in an aggregate record. An aggregate record is created by taking a group of similar records and tallying the dollars based on a specific set of data fields in order to create one summary (or aggregate) record. The fields that are not used can be left blank. All transactions included in an aggregate record <strong>should</strong> belong to the same fiscal year. Agencies also may continue to report awards below the required reporting threshold in an aggregate record.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>By the statutory deadline [May 9, 2017], agency prime-level data <strong>will</strong> be in compliance with the data standards established under section 4(c) of FFATA, as amended by the DATA Act. In the interim, agencies <strong>should</strong> continue to report data to USAspending.gov under existing guidance until additional DATA Act technical guidance is issued by OMB and Treasury. Future technical guidance <strong>will</strong> provide operational guidelines describing how agencies <strong>will</strong> report these data. Any changes proposed to procurement reporting via FPDS-NG (through May 2017 and beyond) <strong>will</strong> follow appropriate rule-making procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>III. New Requirements for Federal Agencies Pursuant to the DATA Act</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act for additional reporting, development, and implementation of financial data standards on USAspending. gov (or its successor site), this<br />Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agency compliance with the following policies: 1. Make Agency-Level Financial Data Available for Publication. Pursuant to Section 3 of the DATA Act, by <strong>May</strong> 9, 2017, Treasury, in consultation with OMB, <strong>must</strong> publish a report of funds made available to, or expended by, a Federal agency or component of a Federal Agency on USAspending.gov (or its successor site). Reports <strong>should</strong> be published monthly, when practicable, but not less than quarterly. OMB and Treasury <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> fulfill a portion of this requirement by leveraging existing agency reporting. Concurrent with this activity: � Agencies <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> continue to submit agency-level financial data to OMB and Treasury using the Treasury Government-wide Treasury Account Symbol (GTAS) system. � OMB <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> continue to produce bulk, downloadable, machine-readable (e.g., XML) versions of the OMB SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, and post these and other outputs on its website and the White House website. The tags and other technical characteristics in OMB's XML versions of the SF 133 reports <strong>may</strong> change as a result of work on data definitions or for other reasons. � OMB and Treasury <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> make these bulk, downloadable, machine-readable versions of the SF 133 report accessible from USAspending.gov (or its successor site).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act, this<br />Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agency compliance with the following policies:] 2. Implement Data Definition Standards. OMB and/or Treasury <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> post data definition standards in a virtual repository. On the date of this Memorandum's issuance, this repository <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> serve as the authoritative source for such data definition standards pursuant to the DATA Act. Any future regulatory changes that take place as a result of these standards <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> be accomplished in accordance with existing rule-making procedures and in consultation with Federal agencies with authority over procurement and financial assistance awards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The DATA Act <strong>requires</strong> all agencies to use these data definition standards [ref. Req. 79.13] for the collection and reporting of agency-level and award-level data by two years after their issuance. Implementation efforts <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> include agency efforts to modify existing agency regulatory and non-regulatory policies (if required), business processes, and, as needed, systems to support agency-level financial reporting and new data quality requirements under this Memorandum. Agencies <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> modify policies, internal business processes, and/or information technology, as needed, to ensure consistent publication of agency-level and award level reporting under the DATA Act and FF AT A on USAspending.gov (or its successor site).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To implement the requirements pursuant to the DATA Act, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agency compliance with the following policies:] 3. Implement Data Exchange Standards. To publish Federal spending data on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), agencies <strong>will</strong> be <strong>required</strong> to provide data to Treasury under the "data-centric" approach using a standard data exchange ("DATA Act Schema"). This DATA Act Schema includes a standard taxonomy and a standard format, or "language", for exchanging data and provides a comprehensive view of the data definition standards and their relationships to one another. Treasury has created a draft DATA Act Schema for financial data based upon a subset of U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL). The schema is being further developed and refined based on feedback from federal and non-federal stakeholders and additional components <strong>will</strong> be created to capture award-level data elements. The Schema can be found here http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/dataexchange-standard/. The DATA Act Schema <strong>will</strong> be revised periodically to reflect statutory/regulatory changes and append additional data elements. Further, additional components of the DATA Act Schema that capture other data elements <strong>will</strong> be created in the future as needed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Treasury is piloting the data exchange concept [ref. Req. 79.15] with select agencies and <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> issue further guidance and tools, such as open source code and a technical implementation guide, once the pilots are complete. Treasury <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> provide technical assistance to agencies as they adopt the standard exchange format and taxonomy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>IV. Requirements to Ensure Data Quality and Future Reporting Capabilities, consistent with DATA Act Implementation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To ensure the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agencies to: 1. Continue to <strong>Assign</strong> a Unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) for Financial Assistance Awards. All Federal agencies <strong>must</strong> continue to <strong>assign</strong> a unique Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) to each financial assistance award. Once an agency assigns a FAIN and reports it to USAspending.gov, the Federal agency may not, except in limited circumstances, modify the FAIN during the life of the award. Further, once a Federal agency assigns a FAIN, that Federal agency <strong>must</strong> ensure that the FAIN is clearly identified in all Federal award documents. As a term and condition of the award, Federal agencies <strong>must</strong> require that all recipients report subaward information by FAIN into the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). Federal procurement awards continue to be subject to the requirements for uniform procurement instrument identification numbers in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 4.16.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To <strong>ensure</strong> the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agencies to:] 2. <strong>Ensure</strong> Availability of Agency-Level and Award-Level Financial Data Sourced from Agency Financial Systems and Implement Linkage between Agency Financial System(s) and Management Systems Using Award IDs. To improve the quality of agencies' prime award-level Federal spending data required under FFATA, agencies <strong>will be required</strong> to make available financial obligation and outlay data, for both agency-level data (pursuant to Section 3(b) of FFATA, as amended) and award-level data (pursuant to Section 2(b)(l)(B) of FFATA) based on agency financial system(s).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To implement this requirement [to ensure availability of agency-level and award-level financial data sourced from<br />agency financial systems and implement linkage between agency financial fystem(s) and management systems using award IDs, ref. Req. 79.18] agencies <strong>will be required</strong> to carry the prime award ID in agency financial systems, in order to link between an accounting transaction and an award. The award identification (FAIN for financial assistance and Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) for procurement) serves as the key to associate data across award systems and financial systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies moving to financial management Federal Shared Service Providers (FSSPs) <strong>should</strong> consult with their FSSPs to identify appropriate timelines for inclusion in agency implementation plans required under this Memorandum. This linkage will facilitate timely reporting of award level financial data, reduce reporting errors, and serve as the primary mechanism moving forward for associating expenditures with individual awards as required by FFATA and the DATA Act.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[To ensure the high quality of reporting on USAspending.gov (or its successor site), as well as the ability to align financial data with awards, this Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> agencies to:] 3. <strong>Report</strong> All Prime Financial Assistance Awards Above the Micro-Purchase<br />Threshold on a Bi-Weekly Cycle. Currently, pursuant to FFATA, Federal agencies <strong>report</strong>, at least bi-weekly, transactions related to prime awards $25,000 or greater. Agencies <strong>will be required</strong> to submit specific programmatic information about all financial assistance and procurement prime awards greater than the micro purchase threshold (as defined by FAR 2.101) to USAspending.gov within two years of the date of this Memorandum. Agencies currently <strong>report</strong> all procurement awards above the micro purchase threshold to FPDS-NG, which are made available via USAspending.gov, in accordance with current policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Policy to Require Secure Connections across Federal Websites and Web Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> that all publicly accessible Federal websites and web services only provide service through a secure connection. The strongest privacy and integrity protection currently available for public web connections is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[This Memorandum] provides guidance to agencies for making the transition to HTTPS and a deadline by which agencies <strong>must be</strong> in compliance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Private and secure connections are becoming the Internet's baseline, as expressed by the policies ofthe Internet's standards bodies, popular web browsers, and the Internet community of practice. The Federal government <strong>must</strong> adapt to this changing landscape, and benefits by beginning the conversion now. Proactive investment at the Federal level will support faster internet-wide adoption and promote better privacy standards for the entire browsing public.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All browsing activity <strong>should</strong> be considered private and sensitive. An HTTPS-Only standard will eliminate inconsistent, subjective determinations across agencies regarding which content or browsing activity is sensitive in nature, and create a stronger privacy standard government-wide.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Although some Federal websites currently use HTTPS, there has not been a consistent policy in this area. An HTTPS-only mandate will provide the public with a consistent, private browsing experience and position the Federal Government as a leader in Internet security.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>What HTTPS Does</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>HTTPS verifies the identity of a website or web service for a connecting client, and encrypts nearly all information sent between the website or service and the user. Protected information includes cookies, user agent details, URL paths, form submissions, and query string parameters. HTTPS is designed to prevent this information from being read or changed while in transit. HTTPS is a combination ofHTTP and Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a network protocol that establishes an encrypted connection to an authenticated peer over an untrusted network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Challenges and Considerations</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Server Name Indication</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Server Name Indication extension to TLS allows for more efficient use of IP addresses when serving multiple domains. However, these technologies are not supported by some legacy clients. Web service owners <strong>should</strong> evaluate the feasibility of using this technology to improve performance and efficiency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Mixed Content</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Websites served over HTTPS <strong>need to</strong> ensure that all external resources (images, scripts, fonts, iframes, etc.) are also loaded over a secure connection. Modern browsers will refuse to load many insecure resources referenced from within a secure website. When migrating existing websites, this can involve a combination of automated and manual effort to update, replace, or remove references to insecure resources. For some websites, this can be the most time consuming aspect ofthe migration process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>APIs and Services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Web services that serve primarily non-browser clients, such as web APis, <strong>may require</strong> a more gradual and hands-on migration strategy, as not all clients can be expected to be configured for HTTPS connections or to successfully follow redirects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Planning for Change</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Federal websites and services <strong>should</strong> deploy HTTPS in a manner that allows for rapid updates to certificates, cipher choices(including forward secrecy) protocol versions, and other configuration elements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies <strong>should</strong> monitor https.cio.gov and other public resources to keep apprised of current best practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Strict Transport Security</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Websites and services available over HTTPS <strong>must</strong> enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to instruct compliant browsers to assume HTTPS going forward.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once HSTS is in place, domains <strong>can be</strong> submitted to a "preload list used by all major browsers to ensure the HSTS policy is in effect at all times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Cost Effective Implementation</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Guidelines</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> that Federal agencies deploy HTTPS on their domains using the following guidelines. � Newly developed websites and services at all Federal agency domains or subdomains <strong>must</strong> adhere to this policy upon launch.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[This Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> that Federal agencies deploy HTTPS on their domains using the following guidelines.] � For existing websites and services, agencies <strong>should</strong> prioritize deployment using a risk based analysis. Web services that involve an exchange of personally identifiable information (PII), where the content is unambiguously sensitive in nature, or where the content receives a high-level of traffic <strong>should</strong> receive priority and migrate as soon as possible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[This Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> that Federal agencies deploy HTTPS on their domains using the following guidelines.] � Agencies <strong>must</strong> make all existing websites and services accessible through a secure connection  (HTTPS-on1y, with HSTS) by December 3 1, 2016.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[This Memorandum <strong>requires</strong> that Federal agencies deploy HTTPS on their domains using the following guidelines.] � The use of HTTPS is <strong>encouraged</strong> on intranets, but not explicitly required.</p>

<p class='context'>Section B: Implementation of the Common Baseline</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>1</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The "Common Baseline" (Attachment A) <strong>provides</strong> guidance on the CIO's and other Senior Agency Officials' roles and responsibilities for the management of IT. This Common Baseline <strong>provides</strong> a framework for agencies to implement the specific authorities that FITARA <strong>provides</strong> for CFO Act agency CIOs, and builds upon their responsibilities as outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. The Common Baseline also speaks to the roles and responsibilities of other Senior Agency Officials, as it is critical that these officials in each covered agency are engaged in the oversight of IT investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>2</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> institute policies and procedures that implement the roles, responsibilities, and requirements found in the Common Baseline [ref Req. 81.10].</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>3</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agency <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline: � Complete agency self-assessment and plan. Each covered agency <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> conduct a self-assessment that identifies current conformity with or gaps in conformity with the Common Baseline, and <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> articulate an implementation plan describing the changes it <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> make to ensure that all Common Baseline responsibilities described in Attachment A are implemented by December 31, 2015. This <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> include a discussion of how agency senior leaders and program leaders <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> work in partnership to facilitate the successful implementation of the Common Baseline and how the agency CIO <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> be enabled as a strategic partner integrated in shaping Agency strategies, budgets, and operations. The deputy secretary or chief operating officer or higher is responsible for the completion of the self-assessment and plan documents. This self-assessment and implementation plan <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> not exceed 25 pages and <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> include the template in Attachment C or another template approved by OMB.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Each agency <strong>shall</strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:] Submit to OMB for acceptance of self-assessment and implementation plan. Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> submit this self-assessment and this implementation plan for review and approval to OMB's Office of E-Government & Information Technology (E-Gov) as well as to the agency's relevant OMB Resource Management Office no later than August 15, 2015. To fulfill this requirement, the agency deputy secretary or chief operating officer or higher <strong>is responsible</strong> for submitting these documents by email to egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line: �[Agency Abbreviation] <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> Common Baseline Implementation Plan." OMB <strong>may</strong> request additional information from agencies before the self-assessment and implementation plan are approved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[ref. Req. 81.13] Agencies <strong>shall</strong> post the implementation plan portion of this document (posting the self-assessment is optional but encouraged) on their public website at agency.gov/digitalstrategy, and include it as a downloadable dataset in their Public Data Listing, no more than 30 days following OMB approval and thereafter keep the public document up to date with access to a history of previous versions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Each agency <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:] Support ongoing oversight of implementation plan and Common Baseline. Covered agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> follow OMB guidance from PortfolioStat sessions and other oversight activities regarding the ongoing implementation of the Common Baseline. Agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> notify OMB of any obstacles or incomplete implementation of the Common Baseline on an ongoing basis following the initial implementation deadline. OMB <strong>may</strong> request agencies to revise or update agency self-assessments or implementation plans during implementation as more information becomes available about the agency's management processes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Each agency <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:] Conduct annual review and update to self-assessment. Covered agencies <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> update the self-assessment annually to identify any obstacles or incomplete implementation of Common Baseline responsibilities that occurred over the preceding 12 months. The first update <strong>will</strong> be due April 30, 2016, and each April 30 on an annual basis thereafter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>4</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The following additional actions <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> be taken to support agencies' implementation of the Common Baseline: Federal CIO Council (the Council) <strong>shall</strong> develop and share on-going support and tools. Through the end of fiscal year (FY) 2016, the Council <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> dedicate time in its meetings to discuss current topics related to the implementation of the Common Baseline at least once every quarter. The Council <strong>should</strong> consult with the CFO Council in the development of materials to support changes related to the Common Baseline across management domains. The Council <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> also assist agencies in implementing the Common Baseline by sharing examples of agency governance processes and IT policies on a public website at https://management.cio.gov.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following additional actions <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> be taken to support agencies' implementation of the Common Baseline:] Support President's Management Council (PMC) follow-up. By June 30, 2015, the PMC <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> select three members from the Council to provide an update on government wide implementation of FIT ARA on a quarterly basis through the end of FY20 16. These updates <strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong> improve each agency's awareness of policies and processes which have worked well at other agencies.</p>

<li>
<p>Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to report required data to OMB as part of the quarterly IDC per current instructions. OMB <strong>will</strong> continue to update IDC instructions posted on the MAX Federal Community on a quarterly basis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Standardized cost savings metrics and performance indicators. As a part of the IDC reporting requirements, agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to provide cost savings and cost avoidance achieved as a result of strategies that the agency has decided to adopt. Based on this information, agencies <strong>will</strong> be provided a summary scorecard that provides agency-specific performance metric data and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sharing with the public and Congress. As required by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235)10 OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> continue to report quarterly to Congress on the cost savings, avoidance, and reductions in duplicative IT investments resulting from the above agency efforts. OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> also provide a summary of these savings by agency on a publicly accessible website. Agency reporting requirements for these topics are included in the IDC instructions.</p>

<p>Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to provide information to the ITDB, as required by OMB's capital planning and investment control (CPIC) guidance, which is issued annually in conjunction with the release of OMB Circular A-11.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>As a part of that [capital planning and investment control] guidance [ref. Req. 81.22], the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements: Monthly reporting. Covered agencies <strong>shall</strong> continue to provide updates of risks, performance metrics, project, and activity data for major IT investments to the ITDB as soon as the data becomes available, or at least once each calendar month.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] Data improvement program. If OMB or the agency CIO <strong>determines</strong> data reported to the ITDB is not timely and reliable, the CIO (in consultation with the agency head) <strong>must</strong> notify OMB through the IDC and establish within 30 days of this determination an improvement program to address the deficiencies. The CIO <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> collaborate with OMB to develop a plan that includes root cause analysis, timeline to resolve, and lessons learned. In addition, the CIO <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> communicate to OMB the steps the agency is taking to execute the data improvement program and the progress the agency is making. Agencies <strong><strong><strong><strong>will</strong></strong></strong></strong> provide updates on the status of this program on a quarterly basis as a part of their IDC submission until the identified deficiency is resolved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] TechStat Sessions. A TechStat is a face-to-face, evidence-based accountability review of an IT program with agency leadership. TechStat sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in an investment, turning around underperforming investments, or terminating investments if appropriate. For all agency-led TechStat reviews of investments, the agency <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> contact egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line, " [Agency Acronym] TechStat Notification," at least two weeks ahead of the TechStat session. Agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> follow the agency's TechStat policy and procedures based on the CIO.gov TechStat Toolkit when managing TechStat sessions. Agencies <strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong> report the outcomes and outputs of all TechStat sessions through the quarterly IDC, including: the assessment described in Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework, a root cause analysis of performance issues, corrective action plans which address these causes, and a timeline for implementing the corrective actions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[As a part of  thecapital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] High risk rating. Given the size and complexity of the multi-billion dollar Federal IT Portfolio, it is critical to maintain a focus on the health of IT investments across the government. As required by CPIC guidance, the CIO evaluations reported to the ITDB for all major IT investments <strong>must</strong> reflect the CIO's assessment of the current level of risk for any major investment's ability to accomplish its goals based on factors described in the CPIC guidance.</p>
</li>

<p>[As a part of  the capital planning and investment control guidance ref. Req. 81.22, the following approaches <strong>will</strong> be used to meet <a href="#not-implemented">FITARA</a> requirements:] Automatic TechStats. Moreover, if an investment has a high risk rating (red CIO evaluation in the ITDB) for three consecutive months beginning July 1, 2015, agencies <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> hold a TechStat session on that investment. The session <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> be held within 30 days of the completion of the third month. If this investment remains categorized with a red CIO evaluation one year following the Tech Stat session then OMB <strong>may</strong> take appropriate performance and/or budgetary actions until the agency has addressed the root cause and ensured the investment's ability to complete the remaining activities within planned cost and schedule.</p>

Agencies <strong><strong>will be required</strong></strong> to comply with an upcoming new rule regarding purchases of services and supplies of types offered under an FSSI agreement without using an FSSI agreement. In February 2015, the FAR Council initiated rulemaking to implement this provision of FITARA, which creates a preference for strategically sourced vehicles. Once finalized, agencies <strong><strong>will be required</strong></strong> to include in the contract file a brief analysis of the comparative value, including price and non-price factors, between the services and supplies offered under the FSSI and services and supplies offered under the source or sources used for the purchase. This rule will be in addition to other strategies that OFPP is developing around category management, a practice adopted by industry where spending is managed by categories of common spending, like IT and Transportation, and led by experts who promote government wide best practices and help agencies avoid unnecessary duplicative spending and activities.</p>

<p class='context'>CIO assignment plan</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It <strong>is critical</strong> that the agency CIO retain accountability for the roles and responsibilities identified in the Common Baseline.  As agency environments vary considerably, CIOs <strong>may</strong> find that decisions about some IT resources included in the Common Baseline <strong>may</strong> be more appropriately executed by other agency officials, such as a bureau CIO or even parts of program or procurement communities.  This <strong>must</strong> be done in a way to allow the agency CIO to retain accountability.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Agencies which plan to use such a rules-based method <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> describe it in a "CIO Assignment Plan" (Plan) and submit it for OMB approval as detailed in Section B above [ref. Req. 81.53].  Plans <strong><strong>must</strong></strong> show evidence that the CIO retains accountability for the designated alternative agency officials' involvement and decisions and that the appropriate level of rigor <strong>shall</strong> be executed by this official in place of the CIO.  The agency <strong>shall</strong> post the Plan publicly at agency.gov/digitalstrategy  and include it as a downloadable dataset in the agency's Public Data Listing not more than 30 days following the Plan's approval by OMB.</p>

<p class='context'>Attachment D: Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 PortfolioStat</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>PortfolioStat was established in FY 2012 to assess the maturity of Federal IT portfolio management, consolidate and eliminate duplicative spending on Commodity IT, 26 and improve agency processes to drive mission and customer-focused IT solutions. PortfolioStat is an evidence-based, data-driven review of agency IT portfolio management with agency leadership that continues to drive significant cost savings and efficiencies. To date, agencies have saved over $2.59 billion, 27 exceeding the $2.5 billion in savings opportunities identified in the original FY 2012 PortfolioStat sessions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Each year this [PortfoilioStat] process <strong>has</strong> evolved to better align Federal IT policy goals to agency IT portfolios. As part of this evolution, starting in FY 2015 we have changed PortfolioStat from being an annual review session to quarterly reviews.  OMB now collects agency progress data on a quarterly basis and as such <strong>has</strong> an obligation to provide timely performance feedback throughout the year.  Sharing this feedback quarterly will better allow OMB to track progress and recommend course corrections more frequently.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In alignment with the Administration�s core IT objectives, PortfolioStat sessions <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> focus on three key areas: (1) driving value in Federal IT investments, (2) delivering world-class digital services, and (3) protecting Federal IT assets and information.  Prior to each quarterly PortfolioStat session, agencies <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> be provided a scorecard including agency-specific performance metric data (see Fiscal Year 2015 PortfolioStat Performance Metrics below for specific metrics) and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>

<p>Quarterly PortfolioStat activities <strong>will</strong> take place in three phases: (1) Preparation; (2) Session; and (3) Post-Session. The following [ref. Reqs. 81.77 - 81.79] provides details on each phase with guidance on the schedule and requirements to ensure PortfolioStat is consistently implemented.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Phase 1 [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Preparation.  Following each quarterly agency IDC submission, OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> analyze the latest data, consider trends in performance metrics over time, and review past PortfolioStat topics and PortfolioStat action items to identify topics for the upcoming PortfolioStat session�s discussion.  OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> send these topics, analysis, and proposed agenda for each agency to the agency�s PortfolioStat lead.  Agencies <strong>are encouraged</strong> to work closely with OMB to provide clarifications and improvements to the preparation prior to the quarterly PortfolioStat session.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Phase 2  [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Session. Agency PortfolioStat leads <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> work with OMB to schedule a PortfolioStat session to be held within eight weeks following the relevant IDC quarter�s submission deadline.  In the session, OMB and the agency CIO <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> review updates to the agency's Strategic IRM Plan and Enterprise Roadmap, trending data from the agency�s IDC and IT Dashboard submissions, discuss preceding quarterly PortfolioStat action items, status of investments included in High Impact Program(s), and select performance metrics. Based on the discussion, OMB and the agency <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> identify and agree on PortfolioStat action items (with specific deadlines) which OMB <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> send to the agency within two weeks of the completed session. Where appropriate, results from these sessions <strong><strong>shall</strong></strong> be integrated into agency budget submissions and Congressional Budget Justifications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Phase 3  [of the quarterly PortfolioStat activies, ref. Req. 81.76]: Post-Session. Upon receipt of PortfolioStat action items, agency PortfolioStat leads <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> work with OMB to include updates on the status of these items in the next quarterly PortfolioStat.  Agencies that do not meet a deadline identified in a PortfolioStat action item <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> brief the Federal CIO and the agency head at least once per quarter until the action item is complete. Agencies <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> describe progress implementing each PortfolioStat action item as a part of quarterly IDC reporting. At least once per year, agency heads <strong><strong><strong><strong>shall</strong></strong></strong></strong> review with the agency CIO and certify that the reported status of each PortfolioStat action item is accurate and send this certification to OMB.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='context'>Standard Configurations</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective immediately, CIOs <strong>shall</strong> ensure that at least 80% of their agency's new basic laptop and desktop requirements are satisfied with one of the standard configurations posted on the Acquisition Gateway (at https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/) unless an exception is consistent with an approved IT acquisition strategy or plan, as required by OMB's FITARA implementation guidance, and approved in writing by the agency CIO.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Moving to a More Consolidated Acquisition Strategy</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective immediately, except as provided in this policy, all agencies are prohibited from issuing new solicitations for laptops and desktops, and civilian agencies <strong>shall</strong> leverage the following existing vehicles, which were determined by the CMLC [Category Management Leadership Council] to offer the best value for the bulk of the Government's laptop and desktop needs: <br />1) NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP)7 <br />2) General Services Administration (GSA) IT Schedule 708 <br />3) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), NITAAC Chief Information Officer-Commodities and Solutions (CIO-CS)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Exception [to Reqs. 80.01-80.02] for agency-wide, mandatory-use vehicles: Agencies may continue the use of mandatory agency-wide vehicles through the end of the current base or option period, as applicable. To qualify for an exemption, agencies are <strong>required</strong> to implement category management principles in the administration of those vehicles and must, at a minimum: <br />a)appoint an agency category lead for laptops and desktop, who will also actively participate in the WCT [Workstation Category Team]; <br />b) measure and report rates of compliance by bureau, and monitor and address noncompliant spend outside of the mandated vehicle; <br />c) post the agency's mandatory use policy and critical contract data, including terms and conditions, and maintain prices paid on the Acquisition Gateway within 90 days of issuance of this policy; 11 and <br />d) comply with additional guidance identified by OMB or the CMLC [Category Management Leadership Council] to ensure that the agency-wide vehicle continues to deliver the maximum benefit to the agency and that best practices and pricing are shared widely among the acquisition and IT community. <br /><br />Six (6) months prior to the exercise of each additional option period, the agency shall analyze terms/conditions, pricing, performance, fees, and savings under the agency vehicle relative to the approved vehicles, document findings, and provide this information to OMB for approval. Eighteen (18) months prior to any recompetition of these solutions, the agency must submit a business case to OMB that outlines how the agency will transition to the identified vehicles above or how they will make their solution available government-wide, if applicable (transition plan requirements are provided below). Agencies with bureau-wide agreements, or agencies that cannot meet the category management exemption criteria listed above, must transition to the CMLC-approved vehicles by October 1, 2016.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is in reference to Policy 82] DOD <strong>will</strong> continue to execute its Enterpreise Service Initiative. [see http://www.esi.mil/]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[The following is in reference to Policy 82] If a procuring agency would like to fulfill a follow-on or renewable acquisition outside fo the 8(a) Program, it <strong>must</strong> make a written request to and receive the concurrence fo SBA in accordance with the regulations set for at 13 CFR 124.504(d).</p>
</li>

</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Improving Demand Management Practices</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adopt uniform refresh cycles- Agencies <strong>shall</strong> develop and implement policies and procedures in which only a portion of the laptops and desktops are at the end of their useful life and need to be replaced each year. Generally, agency CIOs <strong>shall</strong> adopt a uniform refresh cycle, such as replacing 25% of inventory every year for 4 years or 20% of inventory every year for 5 years.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Aggregate demand to support leveraged buying events - Agencies <strong>should</strong> focus the bulk of their acquisition of laptops and desktops on publicized buying events to maximize the Government's collective buying power. A best practice is to host semi-annual buying events where requirements across agencies are consolidated to leverage buying and drive down costs, and the WCT [Workstation Category Team] will require this practice for GSA Schedule 70, NITAAC CIO-CS, and NASA SEWP. Furthermore, the WCT will work with GSA to create tools on the Acquisition Gateway to help organizations consolidate requirements to better leverage their spending. Agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, participate in these buying events.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p class='context'>Defining the Responsibilities of Laptop and Desktop Category Lead and Contract Manager</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The WCT [Workstation Category Team] <strong>will</strong> serve as the Category Lead for laptops and desktops moving forward. In this capacity, the WCT <strong>will</strong>: <br />a) seek input from agency CIOs to revise and issue new standard configurations every six months <br />b) initiate work on additional standard configurations based on special usage cases, and begin to identify standard configurations for tablets and hybrids to ensure a consistent approach to acquiring and managing these devices; <br />c) seek input from users, including contracting officers, program managers, security officers, and technology officers, to evaluate the performance, value and fees of the approved contract vehicles; <br />d) evaluate vendor performance and pricing; and <br />e) based on the factors above, recommend to OMB on an annual basis: modifications to the list of approved vehicles and improvements for how the Federal Government buys and manages laptops and desktops.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The contract managers of the CMLC [Category Management Leadership Council]-approved vehicles <strong>will</strong>: <br />a) negotiate threshold discounts based on volume to maximize savings for agencies, and provide timely notifications to agencies; <br />b) work with customer agencies to present an agency-specific standard image on the hardware, leveraging any enterprise license agreements, and incorporate into contracts as opportunities arise; <br />c) provide data to the WCT [Workstation Category Team] and the Acquisition Gateway within 90 days and at least every six months thereafter to evaluate pricing, fees, and performance of the contracts; <br />d) report on agency compliance with the requirement to purchase standard configurations; <br />e) evaluate customer/user feedback on vendor performance, offerings, value, customer support on a regular basis and address concerns as needed, in accordance with recent OFPP guidance 14 ; <br />f) work with agencies to develop forecasts for acquisition requirements; and <br />g) sponsor buying events, as appropriate, to aggregate demand.</p>

<p class='context'>Transition Plans and Goals</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To ensure that agencies are able to meet or exceed the schedule and the goals of this policy, civilian CFO Act agency Chief Information Officers and Chief Acquisition Officers have joint, but unique, responsibilities for implementation. Working together, the CIOs and CAOs <strong>shall</strong> develop short transition and implementation plans that address both the new technical and new acquisition requirements set forth in this memorandum. <br /><br />CAOs are responsible for leading the transition to the preferred vehicles and <strong>shall</strong>: <br />a) provide baseline spend data for purchases made through the approved vehicles; <br />b) identify when the agency will phase out existing contracts for laptops and desktops and transition to the preferred vehicles; <br />c) identify how overall small business participation will continue to be met or exceeded; and <br />d) identify current agency-wide vehicles required by mandatory use policies that are proposed to continue because of excellent pricing and performance and other information required in the exceptions section above.</p>

Working together, the CIOs and CAOs <strong>shall</strong> develop short transition and implementation plans that address both the new technical and new acquisition requirements set forth in this memorandum. <br /><br />CIOs are responsible for developing the agency's implementation instructions for this policy that directs, among other things: <br />a) the use of standard configurations; <br />b) the prohibition on new awards; <br />c) related oversight/compliance and other management measures; and <br />d) provide a link to the agency's implementation instructions for this policy, as soon as practicable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Treating laptops and desktops like a commercial commodity will help the Government drive efficiency in this category. However, most agencies have some nuanced requirements that either do not neatly fit into the standard configurations profiles above or are not offered on these vehicles. As such, the goal of this policy is not intended to drive 100% of civilian spend to CMLC-approved contracts, but rather to phase in the policy over time to achieve a Governmentwide goal of 75% by the end of FY18 (agency rates may be higher depending on their needs and policies). The table below <strong>identifies</strong> the phase-in requirements for the Government over time [shown as a list below]: <br /><br />FY 2016: 45%<br />FY 2017: 60%<br />FY 2018: 75%</p>

<p class='context'>Selecting Products and Capabilities</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid unnecessary costs in the future, you <strong>should</strong>, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that all new IT procurements are IPv6 compliant. Any exceptions to the use of IPv6 require the agency's CIO to give advance, written approval. An IPv6 compliant product or system must be able to receive, process, and transmit or forward (as appropriate) IPv6 packets and <strong>should</strong> interoperate with other systems and protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6 modes of operation. Specifically, any new IP product or system developed, acquired, or produced must: <br />� Interoperate with both IPv6 and IPv4 systems and products, <br />� If not initially compliant, provide a migration path and commitment to upgrade to IPv6 for all application and product features by June 2008, and <br />� Have available contractor/vendor IPv6 technical support for development and implementation and fielded product management. <br /><br />The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) will develop, as necessary, a standard to address IPv6 compliance for the Federal government. Additionally, as necessary, the General Services Administration and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council will develop a suitable FAR amendment for use by all agencies.</p>

<p class='context'>Information Technology Management Structure and Governance Framework</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to assure effective management for IT and minimize any disruption during the upcoming transition or any transition of leadership, please review the attached IT governance framework and summarize your agency�s current alignment with each element of the framework via signed memorandum by December 1, 2008. This summary may also include information on activities currently underway or other related management plans. OMB�s Office of EGovernment and Information Technology is here to assist you and your CIO in the implementation of this framework.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In particular, this framework includes the requirement for Heads of Departments and Agencies to consult with the Director of the Office of Management Budget (OMB) prior to appointing an Agency-Appointed CIO, and to advise the Director on matters regarding the authority, responsibilities and organizational resources of the CIO, per OMB Circular A-130 (published November 28, 2000), Section 9, Assignment of Responsibilities. Consultation with OMB on CIO appointments should be factored into your agency�s selection process, and OMB will ensure its input into such selections is expeditious.</p>

<p class='context'>Memo on Transparency and Open Government</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Government <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing. Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset. My Administration <strong>will</strong> take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use. Executive departments and agencies <strong><strong>should</strong></strong> harness new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> also solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Government <strong>should</strong> be participatory. [...] Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information. Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> also solicit public input on how we can increase and improve opportunities for public participation in Government.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Government <strong>should</strong> be collaborative. Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government. Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector. Executive departments and agencies <strong>should</strong> solicit public feedback to assess and improve their level of collaboration and to identify new opportunities for cooperation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I <strong>direct</strong> the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services, to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies, within 120 days, of recommendations for an Open Government Directive, to be issued by the Director of OMB, that instructs executive departments and agencies to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in this memorandum. The independent agencies <strong>should</strong> comply with the Open Government Directive.</p>

<p class='context'>Ensuring the Accessibility of Federal Electronic and Information Technologies Procured by Federal Agencies</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabi litation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (E&IT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs, which reduces barriers to job success and mobility. The law also helps to ensure that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. The purpose of this letter is to remind Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of their collaborative roles in this area and to suggest activities and tools to help agencies fulfill their responsibilities in implementing the law. <br /><br />The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to acquire accessible E&IT unless an exception applies and is documented. Consideration of the Section 508 standards must be part of the procurement planning process, market research, and requirements definition, and the standards must be included in all applicable solicitations. The General Services Administration (GSA), as part of their statutory requirement to provide technical support for Section 508, assesses the extent to which agencies properly include applicable Section 508 standards using a sampling process of solicitations posted on FedBizOpps over the past few months. Across all agencies, a recent assessment by GSA showed that only 3% of the solicitations that included E&IT properly included the Section 508 standards. While some of the solicitations sampled included references to Section 508, a compliant document must, among other requirements, articulate the specific 508 standards that apply to that solicitation. <br /><br />These results demonstrate we are not adequately incorporating applicable Section 508 standards when acquiring E&IT. CAOs and CIOs should review their procurement and information technology acquisition policies and procedures to validate that the Section 508 standards are appropriately considered and clearly stated in solicitation documents. CAOs should consider sampling agency procurements that include E&IT to ensure they properly specify the appropriate Section 508 standards. Procurements that do not meet the standards should be amended. The attachment includes the assessment criteria that GSA uses, and CAOs should consider using these or similar criteria in their sampling effort. <br /><br />CIOs also have specific obligations to help ensure the applicable Section 508 standards are included in procurements for E&IT. Section 8(b)(xiii) of OMB Circular A- 130, �Management of Federal Information Resources,� requires agencies to ensure selected systems or processes facilitate accessibility under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and CIOs are responsible for monitoring agency implementation.  Additionally, Sections 53 and 300 of OMB Circular A-11, �Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget,� instruct agencies to ensure IT capital planning and control comply with Section 508 requirements.2 CIOs should instruct agency project managers to review capital planning and investment control documentation for compliance with Section 508. <br /><br />As part of its ongoing technical assistance and sampling activities, GSA�s Office of Information Technology Accessibility and Workforce may contact your Section 508 coordinator and the points of contact listed in solicitations that appear not to be compliant to offer additional assistance. <br /><br />A resource available to agencies is the Buy Accessible Wizard at www.buyaccessible.gov. This free tool guides requiring officials through the steps necessary to conduct acquisitions that comply with Section 508. CAOs and CIOs may incorporate the use of this tool into their procurement procedures to improve compliance with the law. Another resource is www.Section508.gov, which has information and free on-line training courses.</p>
